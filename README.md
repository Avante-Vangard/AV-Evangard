2. Choosing Fonts (need a method defined)
  a. built in or build in sups, smcp, c2sc, jalt, onum, lnum. All of these should be scriptable. 
  b. normalize fonts to same em.
3. Build stylesheet, weld text to styles (Vangard-Libre Import)

  b. sizing
  c. styling
4. Prepare Text (Avante-Libre Interface)
