\p
\v 1 ¶ The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
\p
\v 2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;
\p
\v 3 And Judah begat Perez and Zeiah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezrom; and Hezrom begat Aram;
\p
\v 4 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Nashon; and Nashon begat Salmon;
\p
\v 5 And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
\p
\v 6 And Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon of her \add that had been the wife\add* of Uriah;
\p
\v 7 And Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa;
\p
\v 8 And Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Jehoram; and Jehoram begat Uzziah;
\p
\v 9 And Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah;
\p
\v 10 And Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah;
\p
\v 11 And Josiah begat Jehoiakin and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon.
\p
\v 12 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jehoiakin begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zerubabel;
\p
\v 13 And Zerubabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
\p
\v 14 And Azor begat Zadok; and Zadok begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
\p
\v 15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
\p
\v 16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called the Christ.
\p
\v 17 So all the generations \add are,\add* from Abraham to David fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to \add the\add* Christ fourteen generations.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: After his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child by the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just \add man,\add* and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.
\p
\v 20 But while he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
\p
\v 22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
\p
\v 23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
\p
\v 24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:
\p
\v 25 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
\p
\v 2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
\p
\v 3 When Herod the king heard \add these things,\add* he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
\p
\v 4 And, having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.
\p
\v 5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written through the prophet,
\p
\v 6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art not the least among the princes of Judah: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.
\p
\v 7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.
\p
\v 8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found \add him,\add* bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.
\p
\v 9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
\p
\v 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him; and having opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts: gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
\p
\v 12 And being warned of God in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
\p
\v 13 And when they were departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
\p
\v 14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:
\p
\v 15 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
\p
\v 16 ¶ Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the environs thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.
\p
\v 17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
\p
\v 18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping \add for\add* her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
\p
\v 19 ¶ But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
\p
\v 20 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young child’s life.
\p
\v 21 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
\p
\v 22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither; so, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:
\p
\v 23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,
\p
\v 2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
\p
\v 3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\p
\v 4 And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.
\p
\v 5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,
\p
\v 6 And were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
\p
\v 7 ¶ But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\p
\v 8 Bring forth therefore fruit meet for repentance:
\p
\v 9 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to \add our\add* father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
\p
\v 10 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
\p
\v 11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and \add with\add* fire:
\p
\v 12 Whose fan \add is\add* in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshingfloor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.
\p
\v 14 But John opposed him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
\p
\v 15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer \add it to be so\add* now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.
\p
\v 16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:
\p
\v 17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
\p
\v 2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered.
\p
\v 3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
\p
\v 4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
\p
\v 5 Then the devil taketh him into the holy city, and setteth him on the pinnacle of the temple,
\p
\v 6 And saith unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in \add their\add* hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
\p
\v 7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
\p
\v 8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
\p
\v 9 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
\p
\v 10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
\p
\v 11 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;
\p
\v 13 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali:
\p
\v 14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\p
\v 15 The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, \add by\add* the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
\p
\v 16 The people that sat in darkness saw great light; and to them that sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
\p
\v 17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
\p
\v 18 ¶ And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
\p
\v 19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
\p
\v 20 And they straightway left \add their\add* nets, and followed him.
\p
\v 21 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James \add the son\add* of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
\p
\v 22 And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
\p
\v 24 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those that were possessed with demons, and those that were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.
\p
\v 25 And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judaea, and beyond the Jordan.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was seated, his disciples came unto him:
\p
\v 2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
\p
\v 3 Blessed \add are\add* the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 4 Blessed \add are\add* they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
\p
\v 5 Blessed \add are\add* the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
\p
\v 6 Blessed \add are\add* they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
\p
\v 7 Blessed \add are\add* the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
\p
\v 8 Blessed \add are\add* the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
\p
\v 9 Blessed \add are\add* the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
\p
\v 10 Blessed \add are\add* they that are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 11 Blessed are ye, when \add men\add* shall revile you, and persecute \add you,\add* and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
\p
\v 12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great \add is\add* your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
\p
\v 14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.
\p
\v 15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
\p
\v 16 So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
\p
\v 17 ¶ Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
\p
\v 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
\p
\v 19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach \add them,\add* the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed \add the righteousness\add* of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 21 ¶ Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
\p
\v 22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
\p
\v 23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee;
\p
\v 24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
\p
\v 25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
\p
\v 26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
\p
\v 27 ¶ Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
\p
\v 28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
\p
\v 29 And if thy right eye ensnare thee, pluck it out, and cast \add it\add* from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not \add that\add* thy whole body should go into hell.
\p
\v 30 And if thy right hand ensnare thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not \add that\add* thy whole body should go into hell.
\p
\v 31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
\p
\v 32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.
\p
\v 33 ¶ Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
\p
\v 34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:
\p
\v 35 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
\p
\v 36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
\p
\v 37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.
\p
\v 38 ¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
\p
\v 39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not one who doeth thee evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
\p
\v 40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have \add thy\add* cloak also.
\p
\v 41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
\p
\v 42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
\p
\v 43 ¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
\p
\v 44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you;
\p
\v 45 That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
\p
\v 46 For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
\p
\v 47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more \add than others?\add* do not even the publicans so?
\p
\v 48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ Take heed that ye do not your righteous acts before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father who is in heaven.
\p
\v 2 Therefore when thou doest \add thine\add* alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They already have their reward.
\p
\v 3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
\p
\v 4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites \add are:\add* for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They already have their reward.
\p
\v 6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
\p
\v 7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles \add do:\add* for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
\p
\v 8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
\p
\v 9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
\p
\v 10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as \add it is\add* in heaven.
\p
\v 11 Give us this day our daily bread.
\p
\v 12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
\p
\v 13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
\p
\v 14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
\p
\v 15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
\p
\v 16 ¶ Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They already have their reward.
\p
\v 17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
\p
\v 18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
\p
\v 20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
\p
\v 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
\p
\v 22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
\p
\v 23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great \add is\add* the darkness!
\p
\v 24 ¶ No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
\p
\v 25 Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious concerning your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
\p
\v 26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
\p
\v 27 Who of you by anxiety can add one cubit unto his stature?
\p
\v 28 And why be anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
\p
\v 29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
\p
\v 30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, \add shall he\add* not much more \add clothe\add* you, O ye of little faith?
\p
\v 31 Therefore be not anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
\p
\v 32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
\p
\v 33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
\p
\v 34 Therefore, be not anxious concerning the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day \add is\add* the evil thereof.
\c 7
\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 ¶ Judge not, that ye be not judged.
\p
\v 2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
\p
\v 3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
\p
\v 4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam \add is\add* in thine own eye?
\p
\v 5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.
\p
\v 6 ¶ Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
\p
\v 8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
\p
\v 9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
\p
\v 10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
\p
\v 11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
\p
\v 12 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide \add is\add* the gate, and broad \add is\add* the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be that go in thereat:
\p
\v 14 Because narrow \add is\add* the gate, and narrow \add is\add* the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
\p
\v 15 ¶ Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
\p
\v 16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
\p
\v 17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
\p
\v 18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither \add can\add* a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
\p
\v 19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
\p
\v 20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
\p
\v 21 ¶ Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.
\p
\v 22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out demons? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
\p
\v 23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
\p
\v 24 ¶ Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon the rock:
\p
\v 25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon the rock.
\p
\v 26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:
\p
\v 27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
\p
\v 28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his teaching:
\p
\v 29 For he taught them as \add one\add* having authority, and not as the scribes.

\v 1 ¶ When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
\p
\v 2 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
\p
\v 3 And Jesus put forth \add his\add* hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
\p
\v 4 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,
\p
\v 6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
\p
\v 7 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
\p
\v 8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
\p
\v 9 For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this \add man,\add* Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 10 When Jesus heard \add it,\add* he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
\p
\v 11 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 12 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\p
\v 13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick of a fever.
\p
\v 15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.
\p
\v 16 ¶ When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with \add his\add* word, and healed all that were sick:
\p
\v 17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare \add our\add* sicknesses.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.
\p
\v 19 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
\p
\v 20 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air \add have\add* nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay \add his\add* head.
\p
\v 21 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
\p
\v 22 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their own dead.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And when he was entered into a boat, his disciples followed him.
\p
\v 24 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.
\p
\v 25 And his disciples came to \add him,\add* and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.
\p
\v 26 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
\p
\v 27 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
\p
\v 28 ¶ And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
\p
\v 29 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
\p
\v 30 And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.
\p
\v 31 So the demons besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.
\p
\v 32 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.
\p
\v 33 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the demons.
\p
\v 34 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought \add him\add* that he would depart out of their region.
\c 9
\cl CHAPTER 9
\p
\v 1 ¶ And he entered into a boat, and passed over, and came into his own city.
\p
\v 2 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.
\p
\v 3 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This \add man\add* blasphemeth.
\p
\v 4 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?
\p
\v 5 For whether is easier, to say, \add Thy\add* sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?
\p
\v 6 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.
\p
\v 7 And he arose, and departed to his house.
\p
\v 8 But when the multitudes saw \add it,\add* they marvelled, and glorified God, who had given such power unto men.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And as Jesus passed on thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.
\p
\v 11 And when the Pharisees saw \add it,\add* they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?
\p
\v 12 But when Jesus heard \add that,\add* he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.
\p
\v 13 But go ye and learn what \add that\add* meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners.
\p
\v 14 ¶ Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
\p
\v 15 And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.
\p
\v 16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.
\p
\v 17 Neither do men put new wine into old wine-skins: else the skins break, and the wine runneth out, and the wine-skins perish: but they put new wine into new wine-skins, and both are preserved.
\p
\v 18 ¶ While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter has just died: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
\p
\v 19 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and \add so did\add* his disciples.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And, behold, a woman, who had been afflicted with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind \add him,\add* and touched the hem of his garment:
\p
\v 21 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.
\p
\v 22 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.
\p
\v 23 And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
\p
\v 24 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
\p
\v 25 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.
\p
\v 26 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, \add Thou\add* Son of David, have mercy on us.
\p
\v 28 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.
\p
\v 29 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.
\p
\v 30 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See \add that\add* no man know \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 31 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.
\p
\v 32 ¶ As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.
\p
\v 33 And when the demon was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
\p
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out demons through the prince of the demons.
\p
\v 35 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
\p
\v 36 ¶ But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
\p
\v 37 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly \add is\add* plenteous, but the labourers \add are\add* few;
\p
\v 38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.
\c 10
\cl CHAPTER 10
\p
\v 1 ¶ And when he had called unto \add him\add* his twelve disciples, he gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
\p
\v 2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James of Zebedee, and John his brother;
\p
\v 3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James \add the son\add* of Alphaeus; and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
\p
\v 4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
\p
\v 5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into \add any\add* city of the Samaritans enter ye not:
\p
\v 6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\p
\v 7 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
\p
\v 8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons: freely ye have received, freely give.
\p
\v 9 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your girdles,
\p
\v 10 Nor wallet for \add your\add* journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet a staff: for the workman is worthy of his food.
\p
\v 11 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.
\p
\v 12 And when ye come into an house, salute it.
\p
\v 13 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
\p
\v 14 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.
\p
\v 15 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.
\p
\v 16 ¶ Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
\p
\v 17 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;
\p
\v 18 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony unto them and the Gentiles.
\p
\v 19 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
\p
\v 20 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaketh in you.
\p
\v 21 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against \add their\add* parents, and cause them to be put to death.
\p
\v 22 And ye shall be hated of all \add men\add* for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
\p
\v 23 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
\p
\v 24 The disciple is not above \add his\add* master, nor the servant above his lord.
\p
\v 25 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more \add shall they call\add* them of his household?
\p
\v 26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
\p
\v 27 What I tell you in darkness, \add that\add* speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, \add that\add* preach ye upon the housetops.
\p
\v 28 And fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
\p
\v 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
\p
\v 30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
\p
\v 31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
\p
\v 32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
\p
\v 33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
\p
\v 34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
\p
\v 35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
\p
\v 36 And a man’s foes \add shall be\add* they of his own household.
\p
\v 37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
\p
\v 38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.
\p
\v 39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
\p
\v 40 ¶ He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
\p
\v 41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
\p
\v 42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold \add water\add* only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
\c 11
\cl CHAPTER 11
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
\p
\v 2 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent his disciples,
\p
\v 3 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
\p
\v 4 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and tell John those things which ye do hear and see:
\p
\v 5 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
\p
\v 6 And blessed is \add he,\add* whosoever shall not be offended in me.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
\p
\v 8 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft \add clothing\add* are in kings’ houses.
\p
\v 9 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.
\p
\v 10 For this is \add he,\add* of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
\p
\v 11 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
\p
\v 12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.
\p
\v 13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
\p
\v 14 And if ye are willing to receive him, this is Elijah, who was to come.
\p
\v 15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\p
\v 16 ¶ But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,
\p
\v 17 And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.
\p
\v 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon.
\p
\v 19 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children.
\p
\v 20 ¶ Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:
\p
\v 21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
\p
\v 22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.
\p
\v 23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
\p
\v 24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
\p
\v 25 ¶ At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
\p
\v 26 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.
\p
\v 27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and \add he\add* to whomsoever the Son shall will to reveal \add him\add*.
\p
\v 28 ¶ Come unto me, all \add ye\add* that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
\p
\v 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
\p
\v 30 For my yoke \add is\add* easy, and my burden is light.
\c 12
\cl CHAPTER 12
\p
\v 1 ¶ At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were an hungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.
\p
\v 2 But when the Pharisees saw \add it,\add* they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.
\p
\v 3 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungered, and they that were with him;
\p
\v 4 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests?
\p
\v 5 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
\p
\v 6 But I say unto you, That one greater than the temple is here.
\p
\v 7 But if ye had known what \add this\add* meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
\p
\v 8 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
\p
\v 9 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:
\p
\v 10 ¶ And, behold, there was a man who had \add his\add* hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him.
\p
\v 11 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift \add it\add* out?
\p
\v 12 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath day.
\p
\v 13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched \add it\add* forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.
\p
\v 14 ¶ Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.
\p
\v 15 But when Jesus knew \add it,\add* he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;
\p
\v 16 And charged them that they should not make him known:
\p
\v 17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\p
\v 18 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.
\p
\v 19 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.
\p
\v 20 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.
\p
\v 21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
\p
\v 22 ¶ Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.
\p
\v 23 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?
\p
\v 24 But when the Pharisees heard \add it,\add* they said, This \add fellow\add* doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.
\p
\v 25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:
\p
\v 26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?
\p
\v 27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your children cast \add them\add* out? therefore they shall be your judges.
\p
\v 28 But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.
\p
\v 29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.
\p
\v 30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.
\p
\v 31 ¶ Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy \add against\add* the \add Holy\add* Spirit shall not be forgiven unto men.
\p
\v 32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in that to come.
\p
\v 33 Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by \add its\add* fruit.
\p
\v 34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
\p
\v 35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
\p
\v 36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
\p
\v 37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
\p
\v 38 ¶ Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.
\p
\v 39 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah:
\p
\v 40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
\p
\v 41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah \add is\add* here.
\p
\v 42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon \add is\add* here.
\p
\v 43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.
\p
\v 44 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth \add it\add* empty, swept, and garnished.
\p
\v 45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last \add state\add* of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.
\p
\v 46 ¶ While he yet talked to the people, behold, \add his\add* mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.
\p
\v 47 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.
\p
\v 48 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
\p
\v 49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
\p
\v 50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
\c 13
\cl CHAPTER 13
\p
\v 1 ¶ The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
\p
\v 2 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a boat, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
\p
\v 3 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
\p
\v 4 And when he sowed, some \add seeds\add* fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them up:
\p
\v 5 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:
\p
\v 6 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
\p
\v 7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:
\p
\v 8 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
\p
\v 9 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\p
\v 10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
\p
\v 11 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
\p
\v 12 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.
\p
\v 13 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
\p
\v 14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, who saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:
\p
\v 15 For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and \add their\add* ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with \add their\add* eyes, and hear with \add their\add* ears, and should understand with \add their\add* heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
\p
\v 16 But blessed \add are\add* your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
\p
\v 17 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous \add men\add* have desired to see \add those things\add* which ye see, and have not seen \add them;\add* and to hear \add those things\add* which ye hear, and have not heard \add them\add*.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
\p
\v 19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth \add it\add* not, then cometh the wicked \add one,\add* and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he that received seed by the way side.
\p
\v 20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and quickly with joy receiveth it;
\p
\v 21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a time: but when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, he is at once offended.
\p
\v 22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
\p
\v 23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth \add it;\add* who also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
\p
\v 24 ¶ Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man who sowed good seed in his field:
\p
\v 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
\p
\v 26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
\p
\v 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?
\p
\v 28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
\p
\v 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
\p
\v 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
\p
\v 31 ¶ Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:
\p
\v 32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.
\p
\v 33 ¶ Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
\p
\v 34 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:
\p
\v 35 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
\p
\v 37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
\p
\v 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \add one;\add* 
\p
\v 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
\p
\v 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.
\p
\v 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
\p
\v 42 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
\p
\v 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whosoever hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\p
\v 44 ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; which, when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
\p
\v 45 ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:
\p
\v 46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
\p
\v 47 ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
\p
\v 48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.
\p
\v 49 So shall it be at the end of the world; the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
\p
\v 50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
\p
\v 51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
\p
\v 52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe \add that is\add* instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man \add that is\add* an householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure \add things\add* new and old.
\p
\v 53 ¶ And it came to pass, \add that\add* when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
\p
\v 54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this \add man\add* this wisdom, and \add these\add* mighty works?
\p
\v 55 Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
\p
\v 56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this \add man\add* all these things?
\p
\v 57 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.
\p
\v 58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
\c 14
\cl CHAPTER 14
\p
\v 1 ¶ At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
\p
\v 2 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.
\p
\v 3 ¶ For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put \add him\add* in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife.
\p
\v 4 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
\p
\v 5 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
\p
\v 6 But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
\p
\v 7 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.
\p
\v 8 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here the head of John the Baptist in a charger.
\p
\v 9 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and them that sat with him at meat, he commanded \add it\add* to be given \add her.\add* 
\p
\v 10 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
\p
\v 11 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought \add it\add* to her mother.
\p
\v 12 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
\p
\v 13 ¶ When Jesus heard \add of it,\add* he departed thence by boat into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard \add thereof,\add* they followed him on foot out of the cities.
\p
\v 14 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.
\p
\v 16 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
\p
\v 17 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
\p
\v 18 He said, Bring them hither to me.
\p
\v 19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to \add his\add* disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
\p
\v 20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
\p
\v 21 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a boat, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
\p
\v 23 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
\p
\v 24 But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
\p
\v 25 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
\p
\v 26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
\p
\v 27 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
\p
\v 28 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.
\p
\v 29 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the boat, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
\p
\v 30 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
\p
\v 31 And immediately Jesus stretched forth \add his\add* hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
\p
\v 32 And when they were come into the boat, the wind ceased.
\p
\v 33 Then they that were in the boat came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
\p
\v 34 ¶ And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
\p
\v 35 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;
\p
\v 36 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
\c 15
\cl CHAPTER 15
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, who were of Jerusalem, saying,
\p
\v 2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
\p
\v 3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition?
\p
\v 4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the \add appointed\add* death.
\p
\v 5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to \add his\add* father or \add his\add* mother, \add It is\add* dedicated \add to God,\add* that by which thou wouldest be profited by me;
\p
\v 6 And honour not his father or his mother, \add he shall be guiltless.\add* Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.
\p
\v 7 Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
\p
\v 8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with \add their\add* lips; but their heart is far from me.
\p
\v 9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching \add for\add* doctrines the commandments of men.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
\p
\v 11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
\p
\v 12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
\p
\v 13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
\p
\v 14 Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
\p
\v 15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
\p
\v 16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?
\p
\v 17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
\p
\v 18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
\p
\v 19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
\p
\v 20 These are \add the things\add* which defile a man: but to eat with unwashed hands defileth not a man.
\p
\v 21 ¶ Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the regions of Tyre and Sidon.
\p
\v 22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same region, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, \add thou\add* son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.
\p
\v 23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
\p
\v 24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\p
\v 25 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
\p
\v 26 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast \add it\add* to dogs.
\p
\v 27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.
\p
\v 28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great \add is\add* thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
\p
\v 29 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the Sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
\p
\v 30 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them \add those that were\add* lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:
\p
\v 31 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
\p
\v 32 ¶ Then Jesus called his disciples \add unto him,\add* and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
\p
\v 33 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
\p
\v 34 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
\p
\v 35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
\p
\v 36 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake \add them,\add* and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
\p
\v 37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken \add meat\add* that was left seven baskets full.
\p
\v 38 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
\p
\v 39 And he sent away the multitude, and took a boat, and came into the regions of Magdala.
\c 16
\cl CHAPTER 16
\p
\v 1 ¶ The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.
\p
\v 2 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, \add It will be\add* fair weather: for the sky is red.
\p
\v 3 And in the morning, \add It will be\add* foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O \add ye\add* hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not \add discern\add* the signs of the times?
\p
\v 4 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he left them, and departed.
\p
\v 5 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
\p
\v 6 ¶ Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
\p
\v 7 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, \add It is\add* because we have taken no bread.
\p
\v 8 \add Which\add* when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
\p
\v 9 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
\p
\v 10 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
\p
\v 11 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake \add it\add* not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
\p
\v 12 Then understood they how that he bade \add them\add* not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
\p
\v 13 ¶ When Jesus came into the regions of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
\p
\v 14 And they said, Some \add say that thou art\add* John the Baptist: some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
\p
\v 15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
\p
\v 16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
\p
\v 17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed \add it\add* unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.
\p
\v 18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
\p
\v 19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\p
\v 20 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
\p
\v 21 ¶ From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
\p
\v 22 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.
\p
\v 23 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.
\p
\v 24 ¶ Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any \add man\add*  would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
\p
\v 25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
\p
\v 26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
\p
\v 27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.
\p
\v 28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
\c 17
\cl CHAPTER 17
\p
\v 1 ¶ And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,
\p
\v 2 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
\p
\v 3 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him.
\p
\v 4 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
\p
\v 5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
\p
\v 6 And when the disciples heard \add it,\add* they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
\p
\v 7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
\p
\v 8 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.
\p
\v 9 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying,  Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.
\p
\v 10 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come?
\p
\v 11 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elijah truly shall first come, and restore all things.
\p
\v 12 But I say unto you, That Elijah is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.
\p
\v 13 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a \add certain\add* man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
\p
\v 15 Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatic, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.
\p
\v 16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
\p
\v 17 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.
\p
\v 18 And Jesus rebuked the demon; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
\p
\v 19 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?
\p
\v 20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
\p
\v 21 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And while they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall soon be delivered into the hands of men:
\p
\v 23 And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute \add money\add* came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?
\p
\v 25 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus went before him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own sons, or from strangers?
\p
\v 26 Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the sons free.
\p
\v 27 Notwithstanding, lest we cause them to stumble, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
\c 18
\cl CHAPTER 18
\p
\v 1 ¶ At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greater in the kingdom of heaven?
\p
\v 2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,
\p
\v 3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.
\p
\v 6 But whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and \add that\add* he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
\p
\v 8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot ensnare thee, cut them off, and cast \add them\add* from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
\p
\v 9 And if thine eye ensnare thee, pluck it out, and cast \add it\add* from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
\p
\v 10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
\p
\v 11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
\p
\v 12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?
\p
\v 13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more over that \add sheep,\add* than over the ninety and nine that went not astray.
\p
\v 14 Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
\p
\v 15 ¶ Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
\p
\v 16 But if he will not hear \add thee, then\add* take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
\p
\v 17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell \add it\add*  unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as a Gentile man and a publican.
\p
\v 18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\p
\v 19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father who is in heaven.
\p
\v 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
\p
\v 21 ¶ Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
\p
\v 22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
\p
\v 23 ¶ Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, who would make an accounting with his servants.
\p
\v 24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, that owed him ten thousand talents.
\p
\v 25 But forasmuch as he had naught wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
\p
\v 26 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
\p
\v 27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.
\p
\v 28 But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, that owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took \add him\add* by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.
\p
\v 29 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
\p
\v 30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
\p
\v 31 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.
\p
\v 32 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:
\p
\v 33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?
\p
\v 34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.
\p
\v 35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

\cl CHAPTER 19
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass, \add that\add* when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the parts of Judaea beyond the Jordan;
\p
\v 2 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
\p
\v 3 ¶ The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
\p
\v 4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he who made \add them\add* at the beginning made them male and female,
\p
\v 5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?
\p
\v 6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
\p
\v 7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
\p
\v 8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.
\p
\v 9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except \add it be\add* for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her that is put away doth commit adultery.
\p
\v 10 ¶ His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with \add his\add* wife, it is not good to marry.
\p
\v 11 But he said unto them, All \add men\add* cannot receive this saying, save \add they\add* to whom it is given.
\p
\v 12 For there are some eunuchs, who were so born from \add their\add* mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, that have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive \add it\add* , let him receive \add it\add* .
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put \add his\add* hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
\p
\v 14 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 15 And he laid \add his\add* hands on them, and departed thence.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
\p
\v 17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? \add there is\add* none good but one, \add that is,\add* God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
\p
\v 18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
\p
\v 19 Honour thy father and \add thy\add* mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
\p
\v 20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
\p
\v 21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go \add and\add* sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come \add and\add* follow me.
\p
\v 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
\p
\v 23 ¶ Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 25 When his disciples heard \add it,\add* they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
\p
\v 26 But Jesus beheld \add them,\add* and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
\p
\v 27 ¶ Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?
\p
\v 28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.
\p
\v 30 But many \add that are\add* first shall be last; and the last \add shall be\add* first.
\c 20
\cl CHAPTER 20
\p
\v 1 ¶ For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man, an householder, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
\p
\v 2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
\p
\v 3 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
\p
\v 4 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
\p
\v 5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
\p
\v 6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
\p
\v 7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, \add that\add* shall ye receive.
\p
\v 8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them \add their\add* hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
\p
\v 9 And when they came that \add were hired\add* about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
\p
\v 10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
\p
\v 11 And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,
\p
\v 12 Saying, These last have wrought \add but\add* one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who have borne the burden and heat of the day.
\p
\v 13 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
\p
\v 14 Take \add that\add* thine \add is,\add* and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.
\p
\v 15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
\p
\v 16 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,
\p
\v 18 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
\p
\v 19 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall rise again.
\p
\v 20 ¶ Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons, worshipping \add him,\add* and desiring a certain thing of him.
\p
\v 21 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
\p
\v 22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.
\p
\v 23 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but \add it shall be given to them\add* for whom it is prepared of my Father.
\p
\v 24 And when the ten heard \add it,\add* they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
\p
\v 25 But Jesus called them \add unto him,\add* and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.
\p
\v 26 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
\p
\v 27 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
\p
\v 28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
\p
\v 29 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
\p
\v 30 ¶ And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, \add thou\add* son of David.
\p
\v 31 And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, \add thou\add* son of David.
\p
\v 32 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?
\p
\v 33 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
\p
\v 34 So Jesus had compassion \add on them,\add* and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
\c 21
\cl CHAPTER 21
\p
\v 1 ¶ And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
\p
\v 2 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose \add them,\add* and bring \add them\add* unto me.
\p
\v 3 And if any \add man\add* say aught unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
\p
\v 4 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
\p
\v 5 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.
\p
\v 6 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,
\p
\v 7 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set \add him\add* thereon.
\p
\v 8 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed \add them\add* in the way.
\p
\v 9 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed \add is\add* he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
\p
\v 10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
\p
\v 11 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
\p
\v 13 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer; but ye are making it a den of robbers.
\p
\v 14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
\p
\v 15 And when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,
\p
\v 16 And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
\p
\v 17 ¶ And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.
\p
\v 18 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
\p
\v 19 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And at once the fig tree withered away.
\p
\v 20 And when the disciples saw \add it,\add* they marvelled, saying, How is it that the fig tree immediately withered away?
\p
\v 21 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this \add which is done\add* to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
\p
\v 22 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
\p
\v 24 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
\p
\v 25 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him?
\p
\v 26 But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.
\p
\v 27 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
\p
\v 28 ¶ But what think ye? A \add certain\add* man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.
\p
\v 29 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.
\p
\v 30 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I \add go,\add* sir: and went not.
\p
\v 31 Which one of the two did the will of \add his\add* father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
\p
\v 32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen \add it,\add* repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.
\p
\v 33 ¶ Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, who planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:
\p
\v 34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.
\p
\v 35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
\p
\v 36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.
\p
\v 37 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
\p
\v 38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.
\p
\v 39 And they caught him, and cast \add him\add* out of the vineyard, and slew \add him.\add* 
\p
\v 40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
\p
\v 41 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out \add his\add* vineyard unto other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
\p
\v 42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
\p
\v 43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
\p
\v 44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
\p
\v 45 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
\p
\v 46 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
\c 22
\cl CHAPTER 22
\p
\v 1 ¶ And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
\p
\v 2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, who made a marriage for his son,
\p
\v 3 And sent forth his servants to call to the wedding those that were bidden: and they would not come.
\p
\v 4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and \add my\add*  fatlings \add are\add* killed, and all things \add are\add* ready: come unto the marriage.
\p
\v 5 But they made light of \add it,\add* and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:
\p
\v 6 And the remnant took his servants, and treated \add them\add* evilly, and slew \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 7 But when the king heard \add thereof,\add* he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
\p
\v 8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.
\p
\v 9 Go ye therefore into the crossings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.
\p
\v 10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment:
\p
\v 12 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
\p
\v 13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast \add him\add* into the outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\p
\v 14 For many are called, but few \add are\add* chosen.
\p
\v 15 ¶ Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in \add his\add* talk.
\p
\v 16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any \add man:\add* for thou regardest not the person of men.
\p
\v 17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
\p
\v 18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, \add ye\add* hypocrites?
\p
\v 19 Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.
\p
\v 20 And he saith unto them, Whose \add is\add* this image and superscription?
\p
\v 21 They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.
\p
\v 22 When they had heard \add these words,\add* they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.
\p
\v 23 ¶ The same day came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
\p
\v 24 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
\p
\v 25 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:
\p
\v 26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
\p
\v 27 And last of all the woman died also.
\p
\v 28 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
\p
\v 29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
\p
\v 30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
\p
\v 31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
\p
\v 32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
\p
\v 33 And when the multitude heard \add this,\add* they were astonished at his teaching.
\p
\v 34 ¶ But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence they were gathered together.
\p
\v 35 Then one of them, \add who was\add* a lawyer, asked \add him a question,\add* tempting him, and saying,
\p
\v 36 Master, which \add is\add* the great commandment in the law?
\p
\v 37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
\p
\v 38 This is the first and great commandment.
\p
\v 39 And the second \add is\add* like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
\p
\v 40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
\p
\v 41 ¶ While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
\p
\v 42 Saying, What think ye of the Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, \add The son\add* of David.
\p
\v 43 He saith unto them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,
\p
\v 44 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?
\p
\v 45 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
\p
\v 46 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any \add man\add* from that day forth ask him any more \add questions\add*.
\c 23
\cl CHAPTER 23
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
\p
\v 2 Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat:
\p
\v 3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, \add that\add* observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.
\p
\v 4 For they bind heavy burdens and lay \add them\add* on men’s shoulders; but they \add themselves\add* will not move them with one of their fingers.
\p
\v 5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
\p
\v 6 And love the uppermost places at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
\p
\v 7 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi.
\p
\v 8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, \add even\add* Christ; and all ye are brethren.
\p
\v 9 And call no \add man\add* your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, who is in heaven.
\p
\v 10 Neither be ye called leaders: for one is your Leader, \add even\add* Christ.
\p
\v 11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
\p
\v 12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
\p
\v 13 ¶ But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in \add yourselves,\add* neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
\p
\v 14 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater condemnation.
\p
\v 15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
\p
\v 16 Woe unto you, \add ye\add* blind guides, that say, Whosoever shall swear by the sanctuary, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the sanctuary, he is a debtor!
\p
\v 17 \add Ye\add* fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the sanctuary that sanctifieth the gold?
\p
\v 18 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.
\p
\v 19 \add Ye\add* fools and blind: for whether \add is\add* greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
\p
\v 20 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
\p
\v 21 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.
\p
\v 22 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
\p
\v 23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier \add matters\add* of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
\p
\v 24 \add Ye\add* blind guides, who strain out the gnat, and swallow a camel.
\p
\v 25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
\p
\v 26 \add Thou\add* blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
\p
\v 27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but are within full of dead \add men’s\add* bones, and of all uncleanness.
\p
\v 28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
\p
\v 29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,
\p
\v 30 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
\p
\v 31 Wherefore ye are witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them that killed the prophets.

\v 32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.

\p
\v 35 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar.

\v 36 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
\p
\v 37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, \add thou\add* that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under \add her\add* wings, and ye would not!
\p
\v 38 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
\p
\v 39 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed \add is\add* he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

\cl CHAPTER 24
\p
\v 1 ¶ And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to \add him\add* to show him the buildings of the temple.
\p
\v 2 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
\p
\v 3 ¶ And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what \add shall be\add* the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
\p
\v 4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
\p
\v 5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
\p
\v 6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all \add these things\add* must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
\p
\v 7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
\p
\v 8 All these \add are\add* the beginning of sorrows.
\p
\v 9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my name’s sake.
\p
\v 10 And then shall many be stumbled, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
\p
\v 11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
\p
\v 12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of the most shall grow cold.
\p
\v 13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
\p
\v 14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all the nations; and then shall the end come.
\p
\v 15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)
\p
\v 16 Then let them that are in Judaea flee into the mountains:
\p
\v 17 Let him that is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:
\p
\v 18 Neither let him that is in the field return back to take his clothes.
\p
\v 19 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
\p
\v 20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:
\p
\v 21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
\p
\v 22 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.
\p
\v 23 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here \add is\add*  the Christ, or there; believe \add it\add* not.
\p
\v 24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if \add it were\add*  possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
\p
\v 25 Behold, I have told you before.
\p
\v 26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, \add he is\add* in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe \add it\add* not.
\p
\v 27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
\p
\v 28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the vultures be gathered together.
\p
\v 29 ¶ Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
\p
\v 30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
\p
\v 31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
\p
\v 32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When its branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:
\p
\v 33 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that he is near, \add even\add* at the doors.
\p
\v 34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.
\p
\v 35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
\p
\v 36 ¶ But of that day and hour knoweth no one, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
\p
\v 37 But as the days of Noah \add were,\add* so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
\p
\v 38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
\p
\v 39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
\p
\v 40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
\p
\v 41 Two \add women shall be\add* grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
\p
\v 42 ¶ Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
\p
\v 43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through.
\p
\v 44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.
\p
\v 45 Who then is that faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
\p
\v 46 Blessed \add is\add* that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
\p
\v 47 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.
\p
\v 48 But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
\p
\v 49 And shall begin to smite \add his\add* fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
\p
\v 50 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for \add him,\add* and in an hour that he is not aware of,
\p
\v 51 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint \add him\add* his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\c 25
\cl CHAPTER 25
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
\p
\v 2 And five of them were wise, and five \add were\add* foolish.
\p
\v 3 They that \add were\add* foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
\p
\v 4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
\p
\v 5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
\p
\v 6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
\p
\v 7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
\p
\v 8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.
\p
\v 9 But the wise answered, saying, \add Not so;\add* lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
\p
\v 10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.
\p
\v 11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
\p
\v 12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
\p
\v 13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour.
\p
\v 14 ¶ For \add it is\add* as a man travelling into a far country, \add who\add* called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
\p
\v 15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
\p
\v 16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and gained other five talents.
\p
\v 17 And likewise he that \add had received\add* two, he also gained other two.
\p
\v 18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
\p
\v 19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
\p
\v 20 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
\p
\v 21 His lord said unto him, Well done, \add thou\add* good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
\p
\v 22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
\p
\v 23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
\p
\v 24 Then he that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed:
\p
\v 25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, \add there\add* thou hast \add that is\add* thine.
\p
\v 26 His lord answered and said unto him, \add Thou\add* wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed:
\p
\v 27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and \add then\add* at my coming I should have received mine own with interest.
\p
\v 28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give \add it\add*  unto him that hath ten talents.
\p
\v 29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
\p
\v 30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\p
\v 31 ¶ When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
\p
\v 32 And before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats:
\p
\v 33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
\p
\v 34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
\p
\v 35 For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
\p
\v 36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
\p
\v 37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed \add thee?\add* or thirsty, and gave \add thee\add* drink?
\p
\v 38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took \add thee\add* in? or naked, and clothed \add thee?\add* 
\p
\v 39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
\p
\v 40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done \add it\add* unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done \add it\add* unto me.
\p
\v 41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
\p
\v 42 For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
\p
\v 43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
\p
\v 44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
\p
\v 45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did \add it\add* not to one of the least of these, ye did \add it\add* not to me.
\p
\v 46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

\cl CHAPTER 26
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,
\p
\v 2 Ye know that after two days is \add the feast of\add* the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
\p
\v 3 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
\p
\v 4 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill \add him.\add* 
\p
\v 5 But they said, Not on the feast \add day,\add* lest there be an uproar among the people.
\p
\v 6 ¶ Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
\p
\v 7 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat \add at meat.\add* 
\p
\v 8 But when his disciples saw \add it,\add* they had indignation, saying, To what purpose \add is\add* this waste?
\p
\v 9 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
\p
\v 10 When Jesus understood \add it,\add* he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
\p
\v 11 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
\p
\v 12 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did \add it\add* for my burial.
\p
\v 13 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, \add there\add* shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.
\p
\v 14 ¶ Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
\p
\v 15 And said \add unto them,\add* What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
\p
\v 16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
\p
\v 17 ¶ Now the first \add day\add* of the \add feast of\add* unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
\p
\v 18 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
\p
\v 19 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
\p
\v 20 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
\p
\v 21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
\p
\v 22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
\p
\v 23 And he answered and said, He that dippeth \add his\add*  hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
\p
\v 24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.
\p
\v 25 Then Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Rabbi, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.
\p
\v 26 ¶ And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed \add it,\add* and brake \add it,\add* and gave \add it\add* to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
\p
\v 27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave \add it\add* to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
\p
\v 28 For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
\p
\v 29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.
\p
\v 30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
\p
\v 31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
\p
\v 32 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
\p
\v 33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all \add men\add* shall be offended because of thee, \add yet\add* will I never be offended.
\p
\v 34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
\p
\v 35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
\p
\v 36 ¶ Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
\p
\v 37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
\p
\v 38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
\p
\v 39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou \add wilt.\add* 
\p
\v 40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
\p
\v 41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed \add is\add* willing, but the flesh \add is\add* weak.
\p
\v 42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
\p
\v 43 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
\p
\v 44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
\p
\v 45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take \add your\add* rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\p
\v 46 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.
\p
\v 47 ¶ And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
\p
\v 48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
\p
\v 49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.
\p
\v 50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
\p
\v 51 And, behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out \add his\add* hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest, and smote off his ear.
\p
\v 52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
\p
\v 53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall instantly give me more than twelve legions of angels?
\p
\v 54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
\p
\v 55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
\p
\v 56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
\p
\v 57 ¶ And they that had laid hold on Jesus led \add him\add* away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
\p
\v 58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s court, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.
\p
\v 59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
\p
\v 60 But found none, though many false witnesses came. At the last came two false witnesses,
\p
\v 61 And said, This \add man\add* said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.
\p
\v 62 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what \add is it that\add* these witness against thee?
\p
\v 63 But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.
\p
\v 64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
\p
\v 65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
\p
\v 66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
\p
\v 67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote \add him\add* with the palms of their hands,
\p
\v 68 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
\p
\v 69 ¶ Now Peter sat without in the court: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
\p
\v 70 But he denied before \add them\add* all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
\p
\v 71 And when he had gone out into the porch, another \add maid\add* saw him, and said unto them that were there, This \add man\add* was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
\p
\v 72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
\p
\v 73 And after a while came unto \add him\add* those that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art \add one\add* of them; for thy speech betrayeth thee.
\p
\v 74 Then began he to curse and to swear, \add saying,\add* I know not the man. And immediately a cock crew.
\p
\v 75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
\c 27
\cl CHAPTER 27
\p
\v 1 ¶ When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
\p
\v 2 And when they had bound him, they led \add him\add* away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
\p
\v 3 ¶ Then Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
\p
\v 4 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood. And they said, What \add is that\add* to us? see thou \add to that.\add* 
\p
\v 5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
\p
\v 6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
\p
\v 7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.
\p
\v 8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.
\p
\v 9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
\p
\v 10 And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.
\p
\v 11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.
\p
\v 12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
\p
\v 13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
\p
\v 14 And he answered him never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
\p
\v 15 Now at \add that\add* feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.
\p
\v 16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
\p
\v 17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?
\p
\v 18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
\p
\v 19 ¶ When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
\p
\v 20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
\p
\v 21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.
\p
\v 22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ? \add They\add* all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
\p
\v 23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
\p
\v 24 ¶ When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but \add that\add* rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed \add his\add* hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye \add to it.\add* 
\p
\v 25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood \add be\add* on us, and on our children.
\p
\v 26 ¶ Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered \add him\add* to be crucified.
\p
\v 27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band \add of soldiers.\add* 
\p
\v 28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
\p
\v 29 ¶ And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put \add it\add* upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
\p
\v 30 And they spat upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.
\p
\v 31 And after they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify \add him.\add* 
\p
\v 32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.
\p
\v 33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say. The place of a skull,
\p
\v 34 ¶ They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted \add thereof,\add* he would not drink.
\p
\v 35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.
\p
\v 36 And sitting down they watched him there;
\p
\v 37 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\p
\v 38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.
\p
\v 39 ¶ And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,
\p
\v 40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest \add it\add* in three days, save thyself. If thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.
\p
\v 41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking \add him,\add* with the scribes and elders, said,
\p
\v 42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
\p
\v 43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
\p
\v 44 The thieves also, that were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.
\p
\v 45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
\p
\v 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,  Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
\p
\v 47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard \add that,\add* said, This \add man\add* calleth for Elijah.
\p
\v 48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled \add it\add* with vinegar, and put \add it\add* on a reed, and gave him to drink.
\p
\v 49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.
\p
\v 50 ¶ Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up his spirit.
\p
\v 51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent;
\p
\v 52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints that slept arose,
\p
\v 53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
\p
\v 54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
\p
\v 55 And many women were there beholding afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
\p
\v 56 Among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.
\p
\v 57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:
\p
\v 58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
\p
\v 59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
\p
\v 60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.
\p
\v 61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
\p
\v 62 ¶ Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
\p
\v 63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
\p
\v 64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.
\p
\v 65 Pilate said unto them, Ye may have a guard: go your way, make \add it\add* as sure as ye can.
\p
\v 66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a guard.
\c 28
\cl CHAPTER 28
\p
\v 1 ¶ In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first \add day\add* of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
\p
\v 2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
\p
\v 3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
\p
\v 4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead \add men.\add* 
\p
\v 5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, who was crucified.
\p
\v 6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
\p
\v 7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
\p
\v 8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying,  All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
\p
\v 10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Now when they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
\p
\v 12 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
\p
\v 13 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him \add away\add* while we slept.
\p
\v 14 And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.
\p
\v 15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
\p
\v 16 ¶ Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
\p
\v 17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
\p
\v 18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All authority is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
\p
\v 19 Go ye therefore, and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit:
\p
\v 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, \add even\add* unto the end of the world.

\mt3 The Gospel According to
\mt1 St. Mark
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
\p
\v 2 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
\p
\v 3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\p
\v 4 John came baptizing in the wilderness, and preaching a baptism of repentance unto the remission of sins.
\p
\v 5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
\p
\v 6 And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
\p
\v 7 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
\p
\v 8 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.
\p
\v 10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:
\p
\v 11 And there came a voice from heaven, \add saying,\add* Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
\p
\v 12 And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
\p
\v 13 And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
\p
\v 14 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
\p
\v 15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
\p
\v 16 Now as he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
\p
\v 17 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
\p
\v 18 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
\p
\v 19 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the \add son\add* of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.
\p
\v 20 And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.
\p
\v 21 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
\p
\v 22 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
\p
\v 23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
\p
\v 24 Saying, Let \add us\add* alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
\p
\v 25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
\p
\v 26 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.
\p
\v 27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine \add is\add* this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.
\p
\v 28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
\p
\v 29 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
\p
\v 30 But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.
\p
\v 31 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
\p
\v 32 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with demons.
\p
\v 33 And all the city was gathered together at the door.
\p
\v 34 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.
\p
\v 35 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
\p
\v 36 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. 
\p
\v 37 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All \add men\add* seek for thee. 
\p
\v 38 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.
\p
\v 39 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out demons.
\p
\v 40 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
\p
\v 41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth \add his\add* hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.
\p
\v 42 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
\p
\v 43 And he charged him strictly, and forthwith sent him away;
\p
\v 44 And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
\p
\v 45 But he went out, and began to publish \add it\add* much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ And again he entered into Capernaum after \add some\add* days; and it was noised that he was in the house.
\p
\v 2 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive \add them,\add* no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.
\p
\v 3 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, who was borne of four.
\p
\v 4 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken \add it\add* up, they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay.
\p
\v 5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.
\p
\v 6 But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
\p
\v 7 Why doth this \add man\add* thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?
\p
\v 8 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?
\p
\v 9 Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, \add Thy\add* sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?
\p
\v 10 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)
\p
\v 11 I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.
\p
\v 12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
\p
\v 13 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
\p
\v 14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the \add son\add* of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
\p
\v 15 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
\p
\v 16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
\p
\v 17 When Jesus heard \add it,\add* he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\p
\v 18 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were holding a fast: and they came and said unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
\p
\v 19 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
\p
\v 20 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
\p
\v 21 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.
\p
\v 22 And no man putteth new wine into old wine-skins: else the new wine doth burst the wine-skins, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins will be marred: but new wine must be put into new wine-skins.
\p
\v 23 And it came to pass, that he went through the grain fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.
\p
\v 24 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
\p
\v 25 And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungered, he, and they that were with him?
\p
\v 26 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the showbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them that were with him?
\p
\v 27 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:
\p
\v 28 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ And he entered again into a synagogue; and there was a man there who had a withered hand.
\p
\v 2 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
\p
\v 3 And he saith unto the man who had the withered hand, Stand forth.
\p
\v 4 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath day, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.
\p
\v 5 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched \add it\add* out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
\p
\v 6 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
\p
\v 7 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him: and from Judaea,
\p
\v 8 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and \add from\add* beyond the Jordan; and a great multitude from about Tyre and Sidon, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
\p
\v 9 And he spake to his disciples, that a small boat should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
\p
\v 10 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
\p
\v 11 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
\p
\v 12 And he charged them strictly that they should not make him known.
\p
\v 13 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth \add unto him\add* whom he would: and they came unto him.
\p
\v 14 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
\p
\v 15 And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons:
\p
\v 16 And Simon he surnamed Peter;
\p
\v 17 And James the \add son\add* of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:
\p
\v 18 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the \add son\add* of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
\p
\v 19 And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
\p
\v 20 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
\p
\v 21 And when his friends heard \add of it,\add* they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub; and, By the prince of the demons casteth he out demons.
\p
\v 23 And he called them \add unto him,\add* and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
\p
\v 24 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
\p
\v 25 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
\p
\v 26 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.
\p
\v 27 But no man can enter a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, unless he first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.
\p
\v 28 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:
\p
\v 29 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin:
\p
\v 30 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
\p
\v 31 ¶ There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
\p
\v 32 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
\p
\v 33 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
\p
\v 34 And he looked round about on them that sat about him, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren!
\p
\v 35 For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
\p
\v 2 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
\p
\v 3 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
\p
\v 4 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
\p
\v 5 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
\p
\v 6 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
\p
\v 7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
\p
\v 8 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundredfold.
\p
\v 9 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\p
\v 10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
\p
\v 11 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these \add things\add* are done in parables:
\p
\v 12 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and \add their\add* sins should be forgiven them.
\p
\v 13 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?
\p
\v 14 ¶ The sower soweth the word.
\p
\v 15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.
\p
\v 16 And these are they likewise that are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
\p
\v 17 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they stumble. 
\p
\v 18 And these are they that are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,
\p
\v 19 And the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
\p
\v 20 And those are they that were sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive \add it,\add* and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.
\p
\v 21 ¶ And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?
\p
\v 22 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.
\p
\v 23 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
\p
\v 24 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.
\p
\v 25 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.
\p
\v 26 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
\p
\v 27 And should sleep and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.
\p
\v 28 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
\p
\v 29 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
\p
\v 30 ¶ And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
\p
\v 31 \add It is\add* like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth:
\p
\v 32 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
\p
\v 33 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 34 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
\p
\v 35 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.
\p
\v 36 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the boat. And there were also with him other little boats.
\p
\v 37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was now becoming full.
\p
\v 38 And he was in the hinder part of the boat, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
\p
\v 39 And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
\p
\v 40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?
\p
\v 41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
\p
\v 2 And when he was come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
\p
\v 3 Who had \add his\add* dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:
\p
\v 4 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been pulled asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any \add man\add* tame him.
\p
\v 5 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
\p
\v 6 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
\p
\v 7 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, \add thou\add* Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
\p
\v 8 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, \add thou\add* unclean spirit.
\p
\v 9 And he asked him, What \add is\add* thy name? And he answered, saying, My name \add is\add* Legion: for we are many.
\p
\v 10 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
\p
\v 11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
\p
\v 12 And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
\p
\v 13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.
\p
\v 14 And they that fed the swine fled, and told \add it\add* in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
\p
\v 15 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the demon, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
\p
\v 16 And they that saw \add it\add* told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the demon, and \add also\add* concerning the swine.
\p
\v 17 And they began to pray him to depart from their regions.
\p
\v 18 And when he was come into the boat, he that had been possessed with the demon prayed him that he might be with him.
\p
\v 19 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.
\p
\v 20 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all \add men\add* did marvel.
\p
\v 21 And when Jesus was passed over again by boat unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.
\p
\v 22 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
\p
\v 23 And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: \add I pray thee,\add* come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed, and live.
\p
\v 24 And \add Jesus\add* went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.
\p
\v 25 And a certain woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years,
\p
\v 26 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
\p
\v 27 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.
\p
\v 28 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
\p
\v 29 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in \add her\add* body that she was healed of that plague.
\p
\v 30 And immediately Jesus, knowing in himself that power had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?
\p
\v 31 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
\p
\v 32 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
\p
\v 33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
\p
\v 34 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
\p
\v 35 While he yet spake, there came from the synagogue ruler’s \add house certain\add* who said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?
\p
\v 36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.
\p
\v 37 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
\p
\v 38 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
\p
\v 39 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
\p
\v 40 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.
\p
\v 41 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.
\p
\v 42 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was \add of the age\add* of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
\p
\v 43 And he strictly charged them that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
\p
\v 2 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing \add him\add* were astonished, saying, From whence hath this \add man\add* these things? and what wisdom \add is\add* this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
\p
\v 3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and of Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were disquieted by him.
\p
\v 4 But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
\p
\v 5 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 6 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And he called \add unto him\add* the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
\p
\v 8 And commanded them that they should take nothing for \add their\add* journey, save a staff only; no bag, no bread, no money in \add their\add* girdle:
\p
\v 9 But \add be\add* shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
\p
\v 10 And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.
\p
\v 11 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
\p
\v 12 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
\p
\v 13 And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed \add them.\add*
\p
\v 14 And king Herod heard \add of him;\add* (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.
\p
\v 15 Others said, That it is Elijah. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
\p
\v 16 But when Herod heard \add thereof,\add* he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.
\p
\v 17 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her.
\p
\v 18 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.
\p
\v 19 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:
\p
\v 20 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and he watched him; and when he had heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
\p
\v 21 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief \add persons\add* of Galilee;
\p
\v 22 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give \add it\add* thee.
\p
\v 23 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give \add it\add* thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
\p
\v 24 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
\p
\v 25 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me immediately on a charger the head of John the Baptist.
\p
\v 26 And the king was exceeding sorry; \add yet\add* for his oath’s sake, and for their sakes who sat with him, he would not refuse her.
\p
\v 27 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
\p
\v 28 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
\p
\v 29 And when his disciples heard \add of it,\add* they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
\p
\v 30 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
\p
\v 31 And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
\p
\v 32 And they departed into a desert place by boat privately.
\p
\v 33 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.
\p
\v 34 And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
\p
\v 35 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time \add is\add* far passed:
\p
\v 36 Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.
\p
\v 37 He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?
\p
\v 38 He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
\p
\v 39 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
\p
\v 40 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
\p
\v 41 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave \add them\add* to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
\p
\v 42 And they did all eat, and were filled.
\p
\v 43 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
\p
\v 44 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
\p
\v 45 And straightway he constrained hisdisciples to get into the boat, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.
\p
\v 46 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
\p
\v 47 And when even was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
\p
\v 48 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
\p
\v 49 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it was a spirit, and cried out:
\p
\v 50 For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
\p
\v 51 And he went up unto them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
\p
\v 52 For they understood not \add the lesson\add* of the loaves, for their heart was hardened.
\p
\v 53 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
\p
\v 54 And when they were come out of the boat, straightway they knew him,
\p
\v 55 And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
\p
\v 56 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
\c 7
\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
\p
\v 3 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, unless they wash \add their\add* hands often, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
\p
\v 4 And \add when they come\add* from the market, unless they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, \add as\add* the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
\p
\v 5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
\p
\v 6 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with \add their\add* lips, but their heart is far from me.
\p
\v 7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching \add for\add* doctrines the commandments of men.
\p
\v 8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, \add as\add* the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
\p
\v 9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
\p
\v 10 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:
\p
\v 11 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, \add It is\add* Corban, that is to say, a gift to God, that whereby thou mightest have been profited by me; \add he shall he free.\add* 
\p
\v 12 And ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother;
\p
\v 13 Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And when he had called all the people \add unto him,\add* he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one \add of you,\add* and understand:
\p
\v 15 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.
\p
\v 16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
\p
\v 17 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
\p
\v 18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, \add it\add* cannot defile him?
\p
\v 19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught: — \add and thus\add* he made clean all meats?
\p
\v 20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.
\p
\v 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
\p
\v 22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
\p
\v 23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And from thence he arose, and went into the regions of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know \add it:\add* but he could not be hid.
\p
\v 25 For a \add certain\add* woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
\p
\v 26 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.
\p
\v 27 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast \add it\add* unto the dogs.
\p
\v 28 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
\p
\v 29 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.
\p
\v 30 And when she was come to her house, she found the demon gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
\p
\v 31 ¶ And again, departing from the regions of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the Sea of Galilee, through the midst of the territories of Decapolis.
\p
\v 32 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
\p
\v 33 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;
\p
\v 34 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
\p
\v 35 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
\p
\v 36 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published \add it;\add* 
\p
\v 37 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
\c 8
\cl CHAPTER 8
\p
\v 1 ¶ In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples \add unto him,\add* and saith unto them,
\p
\v 2 I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have had nothing to eat:
\p
\v 3 And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them have come from far.
\p
\v 4 And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these \add men\add* with bread here in the wilderness?
\p
\v 5 And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
\p
\v 6 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before \add them;\add* and they did set \add them\add* before the people.
\p
\v 7 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 8 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken \add meat\add* that was left seven baskets.
\p
\v 9 And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
\p
\v 10 And straightway he entered into a boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
\p
\v 11 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
\p
\v 12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.
\p
\v 13 And he left them, and entering into the boat again departed to the other side.
\p
\v 14 ¶ Now \add the disciples\add* had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the boat with them more than one loaf.
\p
\v 15 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and \add of\add* the leaven of Herod.
\p
\v 16 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, \add It is\add* because we have no bread.
\p
\v 17 And when Jesus knew \add it,\add* he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?
\p
\v 18 Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
\p
\v 19 When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.
\p
\v 20 And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.
\p
\v 21 And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?
\p
\v 22 ¶ And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
\p
\v 23 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village; and when he had spat on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw aught.
\p
\v 24 And he looked up, and said, I see men, as trees walking.
\p
\v 25 After that he put \add his\add* hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw all things clearly.
\p
\v 26 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell \add it\add* to any in the town.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?
\p
\v 28 And they answered, John the Baptist: but some \add say,\add* Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.
\p
\v 29 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
\p
\v 30 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
\p
\v 31 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and \add of\add* the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
\p
\v 32 And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
\p
\v 33 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou regardest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.
\p
\v 34 ¶ And when he had called the people \add unto him\add* with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
\p
\v 35 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.
\p
\v 36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
\p
\v 37 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
\p
\v 38 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
\c 9
\cl CHAPTER 9
\p
\v 1 ¶ And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, that shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.
\p
\v 2 ¶ And after six days Jesus taketh \add with him\add* Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.
\p
\v 3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can whiten them.
\p
\v 4 And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
\p
\v 5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
\p
\v 6 For he knew not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
\p
\v 7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
\p
\v 8 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
\p
\v 9 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.
\p
\v 10 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
\p
\v 11 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elijah must first come?
\p
\v 12 And he answered and told them, Elijah verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at naught.
\p
\v 13 But I say unto you, That Elijah is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And when he came to the disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them.
\p
\v 15 And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to \add him\add* saluted him.
\p
\v 16 And he asked the scribes, What dispute ye with them?
\p
\v 17 And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit;
\p
\v 18 And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.
\p
\v 19 He answereth them, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.
\p
\v 20 And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
\p
\v 21 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, From childhood.
\p
\v 22 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.
\p
\v 23 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things \add are\add* possible to him that believeth.
\p
\v 24 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
\p
\v 25 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, \add Thou\add* dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
\p
\v 26 And \add the spirit\add* cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.
\p
\v 27 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
\p
\v 28 And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
\p
\v 29 And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
\p
\v 30 ¶ And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 31 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.
\p
\v 32 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
\p
\v 33 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?
\p
\v 34 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who \add should be\add* the greatest.
\p
\v 35 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, \add the same\add* shall be last of all, and servant of all.
\p
\v 36 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,
\p
\v 37 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
\p
\v 38 ¶ And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbade him, because he followeth not us.
\p
\v 39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man that shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.
\p
\v 40 For he that is not against us is for us.
\p
\v 41 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.
\p
\v 42 And whosoever shall ensnare one of \add these\add* little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
\p
\v 43 And if thy hand ensnare thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
\p
\v 44 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
\p
\v 45 And if thy foot ensnare thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
\p
\v 46 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
\p
\v 47 And if thine eye ensnare thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire
\p
\v 48 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
\p
\v 49 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
\p
\v 50 Salt \add is\add* good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.

\cl CHAPTER 10
\p
\v 1 ¶ And he arose from thence, and cometh into the regions of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resorted unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
\p
\v 2 ¶ And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away \add his\add* wife? tempting him.
\p
\v 3 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
\p
\v 4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put \add her\add* away.
\p
\v 5 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.
\p
\v 6 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
\p
\v 7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;
\p
\v 8 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
\p
\v 9 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
\p
\v 10 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same \add matter.\add* 
\p
\v 11 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.
\p
\v 12 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and \add his\add* disciples rebuked those that brought \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 14 But when Jesus saw \add it,\add* he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 15 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
\p
\v 16 And he took them up in his arms, put \add his\add* hands upon them, and blessed them.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And when he was gone forth into the way; there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
\p
\v 18 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? \add there is\add* none good but one, \add that is,\add* God.
\p
\v 19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.
\p
\v 20 And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, and follow me.
\p
\v 22 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
\p
\v 24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
\p
\v 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 26 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
\p
\v 27 And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men \add it is\add* impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.
\p
\v 28 ¶ Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
\p
\v 29 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,
\p
\v 30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
\p
\v 31 But many \add that are\add* first shall be last; and the last first.
\p
\v 32 ¶ And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,
\p
\v 33 \add Saying,\add* Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:
\p
\v 34 And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
\p
\v 35 ¶ And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask.
\p
\v 36 And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
\p
\v 37 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.
\p
\v 38 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
\p
\v 39 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:
\p
\v 40 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but \add it shall be given to them\add* for whom it is prepared.
\p
\v 41 And when the ten heard \add it,\add* they began to be much displeased with James and John.
\p
\v 42 But Jesus called them \add to him,\add* and saith unto them, Ye know that they that are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.
\p
\v 43 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your ministrant:
\p
\v 44 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.
\p
\v 45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
\p
\v 46 ¶ And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
\p
\v 47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, \add thou\add* son of David, have mercy on me.
\p
\v 48 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, \add Thou\add* son of David, have mercy on me.
\p
\v 49 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.
\p
\v 50 And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
\p
\v 51 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.
\p
\v 52 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.

\cl CHAPTER 11
\p
\v 1 ¶ And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
\p
\v 2 And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring \add him.\add* 
\p
\v 3 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.
\p
\v 4 And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.
\p
\v 5 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
\p
\v 6 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.
\p
\v 7 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.
\p
\v 8 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strewed \add them\add* in the way.
\p
\v 9 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed \add is\add* he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
\p
\v 10 Blessed \add be\add* the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
\p
\v 11 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:
\p
\v 13 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not \add yet.\add* 
\p
\v 14 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard \add it\add*.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
\p
\v 16 And would not suffer that any man should carry \add any\add* vessel through the temple.
\p
\v 17 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But ye have made it a den of robbers.
\p
\v 18 And the scribes and chief priests heard \add it,\add* and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because the whole people was astonished at his teaching.
\p
\v 19 And when even was come, they went out of the city.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
\p
\v 21 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
\p
\v 22 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
\p
\v 23 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
\p
\v 24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive \add them,\add* and ye shall have \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any: that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
\p
\v 26 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
\p
\v 28 And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?
\p
\v 29 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
\p
\v 30 The baptism of John, was \add it\add* from heaven, or of men? answer me.
\p
\v 31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
\p
\v 32 But if we shall say, Of men? — they feared the people: for all \add men\add* counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.
\p
\v 33 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
\c 12
\cl CHAPTER 12
\p
\v 1 ¶ And he began to speak unto them by parables. A \add certain\add* man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about \add it,\add* and digged \add a place for\add* the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.
\p
\v 2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
\p
\v 3 And they caught \add him,\add* and beat him, and sent \add him\add* away empty.
\p
\v 4 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded \add him\add* in the head, and sent \add him\add* away shamefully handled.
\p
\v 5 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.
\p
\v 6 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.
\p
\v 7 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.
\p
\v 8 And they took him, and killed \add him,\add* and cast \add him\add* out of the vineyard.
\p
\v 9 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.
\p
\v 10 And have ye not read this scripture: The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner;
\p
\v 11 This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
\p
\v 12 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And they sent unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in \add his\add* words.
\p
\v 14 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
\p
\v 15 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 16 And they brought \add it.\add* And he saith unto them, Whose \add is\add* this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.
\p
\v 17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then come unto him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
\p
\v 19 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave \add his\add* wife \add behind him,\add* and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
\p
\v 20 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
\p
\v 21 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.
\p
\v 22 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.
\p
\v 23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
\p
\v 24 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?
\p
\v 25 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels that are in heaven.
\p
\v 26 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I \add am\add* the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
\p
\v 27 He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.
\p
\v 28 ¶ And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
\p
\v 29 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments \add is,\add* Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
\p
\v 30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.
\p
\v 31 And the second \add is\add* like, \add namely\add* this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
\p
\v 32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
\p
\v 33 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love \add his\add* neighbour as himself, is far more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
\p
\v 34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him \add any question\add*.
\p
\v 35 ¶ And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David?
\p
\v 36 For David himself said by the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
\p
\v 37 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he \add then\add* his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
\p
\v 38 ¶ And he said unto them in his teaching. Beware of the scribes, who love to go in long clothing, and \add love\add* salutations in the marketplaces,
\p
\v 39 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts:
\p
\v 40 Who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation.
\p
\v 41 ¶ And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
\p
\v 42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
\p
\v 43 And he called \add unto him\add* his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they that have cast into the treasury:
\p
\v 44 For all \add they\add* did cast in out of their abundance; but she of her poverty did cast in all that she had, \add even\add* all her living.
\c 13
\cl CHAPTER 13
\p
\v 1 ¶ And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see! what stones! what buildings!
\p
\v 2 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
\p
\v 3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
\p
\v 4 Tell us, when shall these things be? and what \add shall be\add* the sign when all these things are about to be fulfilled?
\p
\v 5 And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any deceive you:
\p 
\v 6 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am \add Christ;\add* and shall deceive many.
\p
\v 7 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be not troubled: for these \add things\add* must come to pass; but the end is not yet.
\p
\v 8 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines: these \add are\add* the beginning of sorrows.
\p
\v 9 ¶ But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony unto them.
\p
\v 10 And the gospel must first be preached among all nations.
\p
\v 11 But when they shall lead \add you,\add* and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 12 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against \add their\add* parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.
\p
\v 13 And ye shall be hated by all \add men\add* for my name’s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
\p
\v 14 ¶ But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:
\p
\v 15 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter \add therein,\add* to take any thing out of his house:
\p
\v 16 And let him that is in the field not turn back again to take up his garment.
\p
\v 17 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
\p
\v 18 And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.
\p
\v 19 For \add in\add* those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.
\p
\v 20 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.
\p
\v 21 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here \add is\add* Christ; or, lo, \add he is\add* there; believe \add him\add* not:
\p
\v 22 For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
\p
\v 23 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.
\p
\v 24 ¶ But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
\p
\v 25 And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
\p
\v 26 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
\p
\v 27 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
\p
\v 28 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When its branch has now become tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:
\p
\v 29 So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things coming to pass, know that he is nigh, \add even\add* at the doors.
\p
\v 30 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.
\p
\v 31 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
\p
\v 32 ¶ But of that day and \add that\add* hour knoweth no man, no, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but only the Father.
\p
\v 33 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
\p
\v 34 It \add is\add* as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, to every man his work, and also commanded the porter to watch.
\p
\v 35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:
\p
\v 36 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
\p
\v 37 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

\cl CHAPTER 14
\p
\v 1 ¶ After two days was \add the feast of\add* the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put \add him\add* to death.
\p
\v 2 But they said, Not on the feast \add day,\add* lest there be an uproar of the people.
\p
\v 3 ¶ And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he reclined at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured \add it\add* on his head.
\p
\v 4 And there were some that had indignation among themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
\p
\v 5 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
\p
\v 6 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.
\p
\v 7 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.
\p
\v 8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body unto the burying.
\p
\v 9 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, \add this\add* also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.
\p
\v 11 And when they heard \add it,\add* they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
\p
\v 13 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.
\p
\v 14 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
\p
\v 15 And he will show you a large upper room furnished \add and\add* prepared: there make ready for us.
\p
\v 16 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
\p
\v 17 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
\p
\v 18 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you that eateth with me shall betray me.
\p
\v 19 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, \add Is\add* it I? and another \add said, Is\add* it I?
\p
\v 20 And he answered and said unto them, \add It is\add* one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.
\p
\v 21 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake \add it,\add* and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
\p
\v 23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave \add it\add* to them: and they all drank of it.
\p
\v 24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many.
\p
\v 25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 26 ¶ And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
\p
\v 27 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
\p
\v 28 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
\p
\v 29 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet \add will\add* not I.
\p
\v 30 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, \add even\add* in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
\p
\v 31 But he spake the more vehemently, If I must die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.
\p
\v 32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.
\p
\v 33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;
\p
\v 34 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.
\p
\v 35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
\p
\v 36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things \add are\add* possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.
\p
\v 37 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?
\p
\v 38 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly \add is\add* ready, but the flesh \add is\add* weak.
\p
\v 39 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.
\p
\v 40 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither knew they what to answer him.
\p
\v 41 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take \add your\add* rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\p
\v 42 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
\p
\v 43 ¶ And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
\p
\v 44 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead \add him\add* away safely.
\p
\v 45 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him many times.
\p
\v 46 ¶ And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
\p
\v 47 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
\p
\v 48 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to take me?
\p
\v 49 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but \add this is allowed that\add* the scriptures may be fulfilled.
\p
\v 50 And they all forsook him, and fled.
\p
\v 51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about \add his\add* naked \add body;\add* and the young men laid hold on him:
\p
\v 52 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
\p
\v 53 ¶ And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
\p
\v 54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the court of the high priest: and he sat with the officers, and warmed himself at the fire.
\p
\v 55 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
\p
\v 56 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
\p
\v 57 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,
\p
\v 58 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.
\p
\v 59 But neither so did their witness agree together.
\p
\v 60 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what \add is it which\add* these witness against thee?
\p
\v 61 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
\p
\v 62 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
\p
\v 63 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?
\p
\v 64 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
\p
\v 65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
\p
\v 66 ¶ And as Peter was beneath in the court, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:
\p
\v 67 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
\p
\v 68 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
\p
\v 69 And the maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is \add one\add* of them.
\p
\v 70 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art \add one\add* of them: for thou also art a Galilaean.
\p
\v 71 But he began to curse and to swear, \add saying,\add* I know not this man of whom ye speak.
\p
\v 72 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.
\c 15
\cl CHAPTER 15
\p
\v 1 ¶ And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried \add him\add* away, and delivered \add him\add* to Pilate.
\p
\v 2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 3 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
\p
\v 4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.
\p
\v 5 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
\p
\v 6 Now at \add that\add* feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
\p
\v 7 And there was \add one\add* named Barabbas, \add who lay\add* bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
\p
\v 8 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire \add him to do\add* as he had ever done unto them.
\p
\v 9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
\p
\v 10 For he understood that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
\p
\v 11 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
\p
\v 12 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do \add unto him\add* whom ye call the King of the Jews?
\p
\v 13 And they cried out again, Crucify him.
\p
\v 14 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And \add so\add* Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged \add him,\add* to be crucified.
\p
\v 16 And the soldiers led him away into the court, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
\p
\v 17 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his \add head,\add* 
\p
\v 18 And began to salute him. Hail, Kingof the Jews!
\p
\v 19 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing \add their\add* knees worshipped him.
\p
\v 20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
\p
\v 21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
\p
\v 22 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
\p
\v 23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received \add it\add* not.
\p
\v 24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
\p
\v 25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
\p
\v 26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\p
\v 27 And with him they crucified two robbers; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
\p
\v 28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
\p
\v 29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest \add it\add* in three days,
\p
\v 30 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
\p
\v 31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
\p
\v 32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
\p
\v 33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
\p
\v 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
\p
\v 35 And some of them that stood by, when they heard \add it,\add* said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.
\p
\v 36 And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put \add it\add* on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.
\p
\v 37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up his spirit.
\p
\v 38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
\p
\v 39 ¶ And when the centurion, who stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up his spirit, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
\p
\v 40 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
\p
\v 41 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women who came up with him unto Jerusalem.
\p
\v 42 ¶ And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
\p
\v 43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable councillor, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
\p
\v 44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling \add unto him\add* the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
\p
\v 45 And when he knew \add it\add* of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
\p
\v 46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
\p
\v 47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary \add the mother\add* of Joses beheld where he was laid.
\c 16
\cl CHAPTER 16
\p
\v 1 ¶ And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the \add mother\add* of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
\p
\v 2 And very early in the morning the first \add day\add* of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
\p
\v 3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
\p
\v 4 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
\p
\v 5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
\p
\v 6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.
\p
\v 7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.
\p
\v 8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any \add man;\add* for they were afraid.
\p
\v 9 ¶ Now when \add Jesus\add* was risen early the first \add day\add* of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.
\p
\v 10 \add And\add* she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
\p
\v 11 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
\p
\v 12 ¶ After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.
\p
\v 13 And they went and told \add it\add* unto the rest: neither believed they them.
\p
\v 14 ¶ Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen.
\p
\v 15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
\p
\v 16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be condemned.
\p
\v 17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;
\p
\v 18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
\p
\v 19 ¶ So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
\p
\v 20 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with \add them,\add* and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.

\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,
\p
\v 2 Even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;
\p
\v 3 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
\p
\v 4 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.
\p
\v 5 ¶ There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and his wife \add was\add* of the daughters of Aaron, and her name \add was\add* Elisabeth.
\p
\v 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
\p
\v 7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were \add now\add* well stricken in years.
\p
\v 8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,
\p
\v 9 According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
\p
\v 10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense.
\p
\v 11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
\p
\v 12 And when Zacharias saw \add him,\add* he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
\p
\v 13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer has been heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
\p
\v 14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
\p
\v 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.
\p
\v 16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
\p
\v 17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
\p
\v 18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
\p
\v 19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee these glad tidings.
\p
\v 20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be fulfilled, because thou believest not my words, which shall be accomplished in their season.
\p
\v 21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.
\p
\v 22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.
\p
\v 23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
\p
\v 24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and secluded herself five months, saying,
\p
\v 25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on \add me,\add* to take away my reproach among men.
\p
\v 26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
\p
\v 27 To a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name \add was\add* Mary.
\p
\v 28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, \add thou that art\add* highly favoured, the Lord \add is\add* with thee: blessed \add art\add* thou among women.
\p
\v 29 And when she saw \add him,\add* she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this could be.
\p
\v 30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
\p
\v 31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
\p
\v 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
\p
\v 33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
\p
\v 34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
\p
\v 35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy One that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
\p
\v 36 And, behold, thy kinswoman Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
\p
\v 37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.
\p
\v 38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
\p
\v 39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;
\p
\v 40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
\p
\v 41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit:
\p
\v 42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed \add art\add* thou among women, and blessed \add is\add* the fruit of thy womb.
\p
\v 43 And whence \add is\add* this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
\p
\v 44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
\p
\v 45 And blessed \add is\add* she that believed that there shall be a fulfilment of those things that were told her from the Lord.
\p
\v 46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,
\p
\v 47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
\p
\v 48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
\p
\v 49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy \add is\add* his name.
\p
\v 50 And his mercy \add is\add* on them that fear him from generation to generation.
\p
\v 51 He hath showed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
\p
\v 52 He hath put down the mighty from thrones, and exalted those of low degree.
\p
\v 53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.
\p
\v 54 He hath helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of \add his\add* mercy;
\p
\v 55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.
\p
\v 56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
\p
\v 57 Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
\p
\v 58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.
\p
\v 59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.
\p
\v 60 And his mother answered and said, Not \add so;\add* but he shall be called John.
\p
\v 61 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.
\p
\v 62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.
\p
\v 63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.
\p
\v 64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue \add loosed,\add* and he spake, and praised God.
\p
\v 65 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.
\p
\v 66 And all they that heard \add them\add* laid \add them\add* up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.
\p
\v 67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
\p
\v 68 Blessed \add be\add* the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,
\p
\v 69 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;
\p
\v 70 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, that have been since the world began:
\p
\v 71 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
\p
\v 72 To perform the mercy \add promised\add* to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;
\p
\v 73 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,
\p
\v 74 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,
\p
\v 75 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.
\p
\v 76 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;
\p
\v 77 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,
\p
\v 78 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us,
\p
\v 79 To give light to them that sit in darkness and \add in\add* the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
\p
\v 80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled.
\p
\v 2 (\add And\add* this enrolment was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
\p
\v 3 And all went to be enrolled, every one into his own city.
\p
\v 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)
\p
\v 5 To be enrolled with Mary his betrothed wife, being great with child.
\p
\v 6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
\p
\v 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
\p
\v 8 Now, there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
\p
\v 9 And, lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
\p
\v 10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all peoples.
\p
\v 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.
\p
\v 12 And this \add shall be\add* a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
\p
\v 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
\p
\v 14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
\p
\v 15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.
\p
\v 16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
\p
\v 17 And when they had seen \add it,\add* they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.
\p
\v 18 And all they that heard wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
\p
\v 19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered \add them\add* in her heart.
\p
\v 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.
\p
\v 21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, who was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
\p
\v 22 And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present \add him\add* to the Lord;
\p
\v 23 (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)
\p
\v 24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
\p
\v 25 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name \add was\add* Simeon; and the same man \add was\add* just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
\p
\v 26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
\p
\v 27 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,
\p
\v 28 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,
\p
\v 29 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:
\p
\v 30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
\p
\v 31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;
\p
\v 32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.
\p
\v 33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.
\p
\v 34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this \add child\add* is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;
\p
\v 35 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
\p
\v 36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;
\p
\v 37 And she \add was\add* a widow of about fourscore and four years, who departed not from the temple, but served \add God\add* with fastings and prayers night and day.
\p
\v 38 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 39 And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
\p
\v 40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
\p
\v 41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.
\p
\v 42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.
\p
\v 43 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not \add of it.\add* 
\p
\v 44 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among \add their\add* kinsfolk and acquaintance.
\p
\v 45 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.
\p
\v 46 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
\p
\v 47 And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.
\p
\v 48 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
\p
\v 49 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?
\p
\v 50 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.
\p
\v 51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
\p
\v 52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,
\p
\v 2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness.
\p
\v 3 And he came into all the country about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins;
\p
\v 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\p
\v 5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways \add shall be\add* made smooth;
\p
\v 6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
\p
\v 7 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\p
\v 8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
\p
\v 9 And even now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
\p
\v 10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?
\p
\v 11 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.
\p
\v 12 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?
\p
\v 13 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.
\p
\v 14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse \add any\add* falsely; and be content with your wages.
\p
\v 15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;
\p
\v 16 John answered, saying unto \add them\add* all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the cord of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire:
\p
\v 17 Whose fan \add is\add* in his hand, and he will thoroughly purify his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.
\p
\v 18 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.
\p
\v 19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him concerning Herodias his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,
\p
\v 20 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.
\p
\v 21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also having been baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
\p
\v 22 And the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

\v 23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, who was \add the son\add* of Heli,

\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ And Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
\p
\v 2 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.
\p
\v 3 And the devil said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.
\p
\v 4 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.
\p
\v 5 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
\p
\v 6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.
\p
\v 7 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
\p
\v 8 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
\p
\v 9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:
\p
\v 10 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:
\p
\v 11 And on \add their\add* hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
\p
\v 12 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
\p
\v 13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.
\p
\v 15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read.
\p
\v 17 And there was delivered unto him the roll of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the roll, he found the place where it was written,
\p
\v 18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
\p
\v 19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
\p
\v 20 And he folded the roll, and he gave \add it\add* again to the attendant, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.
\p
\v 21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.
\p
\v 22 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?
\p
\v 23 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.
\p
\v 24 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.
\p
\v 25 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;
\p
\v 26 But unto none of them was Elijah sent, save unto Sarepta, \add a city\add* of Sidon, unto a woman \add that was\add* a widow.
\p
\v 27 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.
\p
\v 28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,
\p
\v 29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.
\p
\v 30 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,
\p
\v 31 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.
\p
\v 32 And they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.
\p
\v 33 ¶ And in the synagogue there was a man, who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and cried out with a loud voice,
\p
\v 34 Saying, Let \add us\add* alone; what have we to do with thee, \add thou\add* Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.
\p
\v 35 And Jesus rebuked it, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him in the midst, it came out of him, and hurt him not.
\p
\v 36 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word \add is\add* this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
\p
\v 37 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.
\p
\v 38 ¶ And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. And Simon’s wife’s mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.
\p
\v 39 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.
\p
\v 40 ¶ Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
\p
\v 41 And demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking \add them\add* suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.
\p
\v 42 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.
\p
\v 43 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.
\p
\v 44 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,
\p
\v 2 And saw two boats by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing \add their\add* nets.
\p
\v 3 And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the boat.
\p
\v 4 Now when he had done speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.
\p
\v 5 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.
\p
\v 6 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net was breaking.
\p
\v 7 And they beckoned unto \add their\add* partners, who were in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
\p
\v 8 When Simon Peter saw \add it,\add* he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
\p
\v 9 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:
\p
\v 10 And so \add was\add* also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.
\p
\v 11 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on \add his\add* face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
\p
\v 13 And he put forth \add his\add* hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
\p
\v 14 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
\p
\v 15 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
\p
\v 17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was \add present\add* to heal them.
\p
\v 18 ¶ And, behold, men brought in a bed a man who was taken with paralysis: and they sought \add means\add* to bring him in, and to lay \add him\add* before him.
\p
\v 19 And when they could not find by what \add way\add* they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with \add his\add* couch into the midst before Jesus.
\p
\v 20 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
\p
\v 21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
\p
\v 22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?
\p
\v 23 Which is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?
\p
\v 24 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the paralyzed man,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.
\p
\v 25 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.
\p
\v 26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.
\p
\v 28 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
\p
\v 29 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house; and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.
\p
\v 30 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
\p
\v 31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.
\p
\v 32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\p
\v 33 ¶ And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise \add the disciples\add* of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
\p
\v 34 And he said unto them, Can ye make the sons of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
\p
\v 35 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was \add taken\add* out of the new agreeth not with the old.
\p
\v 37 And no man putteth new wine into old wine-skins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and be spilled, and the skins shall perish.
\p
\v 38 But new wine must be put into new wine-skins; and both are preserved.
\p
\v 39 No man also having drunk old \add wine\add* straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the wheat fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of wheat, and did eat, rubbing \add them\add* in \add their\add* hands.
\p
\v 2 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?
\p
\v 3 And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungered, and they that were with him;
\p
\v 4 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?
\p
\v 5 And he said unto them, The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
\p
\v 6 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.
\p
\v 7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find an accusation against him.
\p
\v 8 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man that had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.
\p
\v 9 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy \add it?\add* 
\p
\v 10 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
\p
\v 11 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
\p
\v 12 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And when it was day, he called \add unto him\add* his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;
\p
\v 14 Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
\p
\v 15 Matthew and Thomas, James the \add son\add* of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,
\p
\v 16 And Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, that came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
\p
\v 18 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.
\p
\v 19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed \add them\add* all.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed \add be ye\add* poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 21 Blessed \add are ye\add* that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed \add are ye\add* that weep now: for ye shall laugh.
\p
\v 22 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you \add from their company,\add* and shall reproach \add you,\add* and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.
\p
\v 23 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward \add is\add* great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.
\p
\v 24 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
\p
\v 25 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
\p
\v 26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.
\p
\v 27 ¶ But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you,
\p
\v 28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them that despitefully use you.
\p
\v 29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the \add one\add* cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not \add to take thy\add* coat also.
\p
\v 30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask \add them\add* not again.
\p
\v 31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
\p
\v 32 For if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.
\p
\v 33 And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.
\p
\v 34 And if ye lend \add to them\add* of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.
\p
\v 35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and \add to\add* the evil.
\p
\v 36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
\p
\v 37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:
\p
\v 38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.
\p
\v 39 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?
\p
\v 40 The disciple is not above his master: but every one when he has been perfected shall be as his master.
\p
\v 41 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
\p
\v 42 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me draw out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to draw out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.
\p
\v 43 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
\p
\v 44 For every tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
\p
\v 45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
\p
\v 46 ¶ And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
\p 
\v 47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like:
\p
\v 48 He is like a man who built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.
\p
\v 49 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man who without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.
\c 7
\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now when he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
\p
\v 2 And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.
\p
\v 3 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.
\p
\v 4 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:
\p
\v 5 For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.
\p
\v 6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:
\p
\v 7 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
\p
\v 8 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 9 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
\p
\v 10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.
\p
\v 12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
\p
\v 13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her,  Weep not.
\p
\v 14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare \add him\add* stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
\p
\v 15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
\p
\v 16 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is risen up among us; and, God hath visited his people.
\p
\v 17 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.
\p
\v 18 And the disciples of John showed him of all these things.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And John calling two of his disciples sent \add them\add* to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that is coming? or look we for another?
\p
\v 20 When the men were come unto him, they said, John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that is coming? or look we for another?
\p
\v 21 And in that same hour he cured many from sicknesses and plagues, and from evil spirits; and unto many \add that were\add* blind he gave sight.
\p
\v 22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.
\p
\v 23 And blessed is \add he,\add* whosoever shall not be offended in me.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
\p
\v 25 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings courts.
\p
\v 26 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.
\p
\v 27 This is \add he,\add* of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
\p
\v 28 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
\p
\v 29 And all the people that heard \add him,\add* and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
\p
\v 30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.
\p
\v 31 ¶ And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
\p
\v 32 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.
\p
\v 33 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon.
\p
\v 34 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
\p
\v 35 But wisdom is justified of all her children.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and reclined at meat.
\p
\v 37 And, behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that \add Jesus\add* reclined at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
\p
\v 38 And standing at his feet behind \add him\add* weeping, began to wet his feet with tears, wiping them off with the hairs of her head, and kissing his feet, she anointed \add them\add* with the ointment.
\p
\v 39 Now when the Pharisee who had bidden him saw \add it,\add* he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman \add this is\add* that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.
\p
\v 40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.
\p
\v 41 There was a certain creditor who had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.
\p
\v 42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?
\p
\v 43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that \add he,\add* to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.
\p
\v 44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped \add them\add* with the hairs of her head.
\p
\v 45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
\p
\v 46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.
\p
\v 47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, \add that one\add* loveth little.
\p
\v 48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
\p
\v 49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
\p
\v 50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
\c 8
\cl CHAPTER 8
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve \add were\add* with him,
\p
\v 2 And certain women, who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons,
\p
\v 3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto him of their substance.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:
\p
\v 5 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
\p
\v 6 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.
\p
\v 7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.
\p
\v 8 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\p
\v 9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
\p
\v 10 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.
\p
\v 11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
\p
\v 12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.
\p
\v 13 They on the rock \add are they,\add* who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
\p
\v 14 And that which fell among thorns are they, who, when they have heard, go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
\p
\v 15 But that on the good ground are they, who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep \add it,\add* and bring forth fruit with patience.
\p
\v 16 ¶ No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth \add it\add* under a bed; but setteth \add it\add*  on a candlestick, that they that enter in may see the light.
\p
\v 17 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither \add any thing\add* hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.
\p
\v 18 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Then came to him \add his\add* mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.
\p
\v 20 And it was told him \add by certain\add* who said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.
\p
\v 21 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God, and do it.
\p
\v 22 ¶ Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a boat with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.
\p
\v 23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling, and were in peril.
\p
\v 24 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
\p
\v 25 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.
\p
\v 26 ¶ And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
\p
\v 27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, who had demons long time, and wore no clothes, neither abode in \add any\add* house, but in the tombs.
\p
\v 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, \add thou\add* Son of God, Most High? I beseech thee, torment me not.
\p
\v 29 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the demon into the wilderness.)
\p
\v 30 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many demons were entered into him.
\p
\v 31 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.
\p
\v 32 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would allow them to enter into them. And he allowed them.
\p
\v 33 Then went the demons out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were drowned.
\p
\v 34 When they that fed \add them\add* saw what was done, they fled, and went and told \add it\add* in the city and in the country.
\p
\v 35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the demons were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
\p
\v 36 They also who saw \add it\add* told them by what means he that was possessed of the demons was healed.
\p
\v 37 ¶ Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the boat, and returned back again.
\p
\v 38 Now the man out of whom the demons were sent forth besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,
\p
\v 39 Return to thine own house, and show how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.
\p
\v 40 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people \add gladly\add* received him: for they were all waiting for him.
\p
\v 41 ¶ And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:
\p
\v 42 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.
\p
\v 43 ¶ And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,
\p
\v 44 Came behind \add him,\add* and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
\p
\v 45 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press \add thee,\add* and sayest thou, Who touched me?
\p
\v 46 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.
\p
\v 47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
\p
\v 48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.
\p
\v 49 ¶ While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s \add house,\add* saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.
\p
\v 50 But when Jesus heard \add it,\add* he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.
\p
\v 51 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.
\p
\v 52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.
\p
\v 53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
\p
\v 54 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.
\p
\v 55 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her food.
\p
\v 56 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no one what was done.
\c 9
\cl CHAPTER 9
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then he called the twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
\p
\v 2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
\p
\v 3 And he said unto them, Take nothing for \add your\add* journey, neither staff, nor bag, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.
\p
\v 4 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.
\p
\v 5 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
\p
\v 6 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead;
\p
\v 8 And by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
\p
\v 9 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
\p
\v 11 And the people, when they knew \add it,\add* followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.
\p
\v 12 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.
\p
\v 13 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.
\p
\v 14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples,  Make them sit down by fifties in each company.
\p
\v 15 And they did so, and made them all sit down.
\p
\v 16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
\p
\v 17 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.
\p
\v 18 ¶ And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?
\p
\v 19 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some \add say,\add* Elijah; and others \add say,\add* that one of the old prophets is risen again.
\p
\v 20 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
\p
\v 21 And he strictly charged them, and commanded \add them\add* to tell no man that thing;
\p
\v 22 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And he said to \add them\add* all, If any \add man\add* would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
\p
\v 24 For whosoever would save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
\p
\v 25 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?
\p
\v 26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and the Father’s, and of the holy angels.
\p
\v 27 But I tell you of a truth, there are some standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 28 ¶ And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
\p
\v 29 And as he prayed, the appearance of his countenance was altered, and his raiment \add was\add* white \add and\add* glistening.
\p
\v 30 And, behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah:
\p
\v 31 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 32 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
\p
\v 33 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.
\p
\v 34 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
\p
\v 35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my Beloved: hear him.
\p
\v 36 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they were silent, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.
\p
\v 37 ¶ And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, much people met him.
\p
\v 38 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.
\p
\v 39 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.
\p
\v 40 And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.
\p
\v 41 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring thy son hither.
\p
\v 42 And as he was yet coming, the demon threw him down, and tare \add him.\add* And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him back to his father.
\p
\v 43 ¶ And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,
\p
\v 44 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
\p
\v 45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him concerning that saying.
\p
\v 46 ¶ Then there arose a reasoning among them, who of them should be greatest.
\p
\v 47 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,
\p
\v 48 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.
\p
\v 49 ¶ And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.
\p
\v 50 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid \add him\add* not: for he that is not against us is for us.
\p
\v 51 ¶ And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
\p
\v 52 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
\p
\v 53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 54 And when his disciples James and John saw \add this,\add* they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elijah did?
\p
\v 55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.
\p
\v 56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save \add them.\add* And they went to another village.
\p
\v 57 ¶ And, as they went in the way, a certain \add man\add* said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
\p
\v 58 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air \add have\add* nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay \add his\add* head.
\p
\v 59 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
\p
\v 60 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 61 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, who are at my house.
\p
\v 62 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
\c 10
\cl CHAPTER 10
\p
\v 1 ¶ After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come.
\p
\v 2 Then said he unto them, The harvest truly \add is\add* great, but the labourers \add are\add* few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.
\p
\v 3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
\p
\v 4 Carry neither purse, nor bag, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.
\p
\v 5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace \add be\add* to this house.
\p
\v 6 And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.
\p
\v 7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.
\p
\v 8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:
\p
\v 9 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
\p
\v 10 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,
\p
\v 11 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
\p
\v 12 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
\p
\v 13 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\p
\v 14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.
\p
\v 15 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.
\p
\v 16 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us through thy name.
\p
\v 18 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
\p
\v 19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
\p
\v 20 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.
\p
\v 21 ¶ In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.
\p
\v 22 All things are delivered to me by my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and \add he\add* to whom the Son wills to reveal \add him\add*.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And he turned him unto \add his\add* disciples, and said privately, Blessed \add are\add* the eyes which see the things that ye see:
\p
\v 24 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen \add them;\add* and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard \add them\add*.
\p
\v 25 ¶ And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
\p
\v 26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?
\p
\v 27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.
\p
\v 28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.
\p
\v 29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
\p
\v 30 And Jesus answering said, A certain \add man\add* was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, who stripped him of his raiment, and wounded \add him,\add* and departed, leaving \add him\add* half dead.
\p
\v 31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
\p
\v 32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked \add on him,\add* and passed by on the other side.
\p
\v 33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion \add on him,\add* 
\p
\v 34 And went to \add him,\add* and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
\p
\v 35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave \add them\add* to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.
\p
\v 36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?
\p
\v 37 And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.
\p
\v 38 ¶ Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
\p
\v 39 And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word.
\p
\v 40 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.
\p
\v 41 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things:
\p
\v 42 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
\c 11
\cl CHAPTER 11
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
\p
\v 2 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.
\p
\v 3 Give us day by day our daily bread.
\p
\v 4 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.
\p
\v 5 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
\p
\v 6 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?
\p
\v 7 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
\p
\v 8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.
\p
\v 9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
\p
\v 10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
\p
\v 11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if \add he ask\add* a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
\p
\v 12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
\p
\v 13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall \add your\add* heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
\p
\v 14 ¶ And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.
\p
\v 15 But some of them said, He casteth out demons through Beelzebub the chief of the demons.
\p
\v 16 And others, tempting \add him,\add* sought of him a sign from heaven.
\p
\v 17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house \add divided\add* against a house falleth.
\p
\v 18 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons through Beelzebub.
\p
\v 19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast \add them\add* out? therefore shall they be your judges.
\p
\v 20 But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.
\p
\v 21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:
\p
\v 22 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
\p
\v 23 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
\p
\v 24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.
\p
\v 25 And when he cometh, he findeth \add it\add* swept and garnished.
\p
\v 26 Then goeth he, and taketh \add to him\add* seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last \add state\add* of that man is worse than the first.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou hast sucked.
\p
\v 28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed \add are\add* they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
\p
\v 29 ¶ And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
\p
\v 30 For as Jonah was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
\p
\v 31 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
\p
\v 32 The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
\p
\v 33 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth \add it\add* in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they that come in may see the light.
\p
\v 34 The light of the body is the eye: when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when \add thine eye\add* is evil, thy body also \add is\add* full of darkness.
\p
\v 35 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.
\p
\v 36 If thy whole body therefore \add be\add* full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.
\p
\v 37 ¶ And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.
\p
\v 38 And when the Pharisee saw \add it,\add* he marvelled that he had not first washed before eating.
\p
\v 39 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of rapacity and wickedness.
\p
\v 40 \add Ye\add* fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?
\p
\v 41 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.
\p
\v 42 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over justice and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
\p
\v 43 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.
\p
\v 44 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over \add them\add*  are not aware \add of them\add*.
\p
\v 45 ¶ Then answered one of the lawteachers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.
\p
\v 46 And he said, Woe unto you also, \add ye\add* law-teachers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
\p
\v 47 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
\p
\v 48 Truly ye bear witness that ye approve the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.
\p
\v 49 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and \add some\add* of them they shall slay and persecute:
\p
\v 50 That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
\p
\v 51 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.
\p
\v 52 Woe unto you, law-teachers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and those that were entering in ye hindered.
\p
\v 53 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge \add him\add* vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:
\p
\v 54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
\c 12
\cl CHAPTER 12
\p
\v 1 ¶ In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
\p
\v 2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.
\p
\v 3 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chamber shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
\p
\v 4 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
\p
\v 5 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
\p
\v 6 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
\p
\v 7 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
\p
\v 8 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:
\p
\v 9 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.
\p
\v 10 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven.
\p
\v 11 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and \add unto\add* magistrates, and powers, take ye no anxious thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:
\p
\v 12 For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.
\p
\v 14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
\p
\v 15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
\p
\v 16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
\p
\v 17 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
\p
\v 18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.
\p
\v 19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, \add and\add* be merry.
\p
\v 20 But God said unto him, \add Thou\add* fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?
\p
\v 21 So \add is\add* he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no anxious thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.
\p
\v 23 The life is more than meat, and the body \add is more\add* than raiment.
\p
\v 24 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the birds?
\p
\v 25 And which of you with taking anxious thought can add to his stature one cubit?
\p
\v 26 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?
\p
\v 27 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
\p
\v 28 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more \add will he clothe\add* you, O ye of little faith?
\p
\v 29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.
\p
\v 30 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
\p
\v 31 ¶ But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.
\p
\v 32 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
\p
\v 33 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.
\p
\v 34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
\p
\v 35 Let your loins be girded about, and \add your\add* lights burning;
\p
\v 36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.
\p
\v 37 Blessed \add are\add* those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.
\p
\v 38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find \add them\add* so, blessed are those servants.
\p
\v 39 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.
\p
\v 40 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.
\p
\v 41 ¶ Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?
\p
\v 42 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom \add his\add* lord shall make ruler over his household, to give \add them their\add* portion of meat in due season?
\p
\v 43 Blessed \add is\add* that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
\p
\v 44 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.
\p
\v 45 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
\p
\v 46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for \add him,\add* and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.
\p
\v 47 And that servant, who knew his lord’s will, and prepared not \add himself,\add* neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many \add stripes.\add* 
\p
\v 48 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few \add stripes.\add* For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.
\p
\v 49 ¶ I am come to cast fire on the earth; and what will I, if it is already kindled?
\p
\v 50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!
\p
\v 51 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:
\p
\v 52 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
\p
\v 53 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
\p
\v 54 ¶ And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.
\p
\v 55 And when \add ye see\add* the south wind blow, ye say, There will be great heat; and it cometh to pass.
\p
\v 56 \add Ye\add* hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?
\p
\v 57 Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?
\p
\v 58 ¶ When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, \add as thou art\add* in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he drag thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.
\p
\v 59 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.
\c 13
\cl CHAPTER 13
\p
\v 1 ¶ There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
\p
\v 2 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?
\p
\v 3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
\p
\v 4 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?
\p
\v 5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
\p
\v 6 ¶ He spake also this parable; A certain \add man\add* had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.
\p
\v 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?
\p
\v 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung \add it:\add* 
\p
\v 9 And if it bear fruit, \add well:\add* and if not, \add then\add* after that thou shalt cut it down.
\p
\v 10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And, behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up \add herself.\add* 
\p
\v 12 And when Jesus saw her, he called \add her to him,\add* and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.
\p
\v 13 And he laid \add his\add* hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
\p
\v 14 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.
\p
\v 15 The Lord then answered him, and said, Hypocrite! doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or \add his\add* ass from the stall, and lead \add him\add* away to watering?
\p
\v 16 And ought not this woman, being the daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath?
\p
\v 17 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I liken it?
\p
\v 19 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.
\p
\v 20 And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?
\p
\v 21 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
\p
\v 22 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.
\p
\v 23 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,
\p
\v 24 ¶ Strive to enter in at the narrow gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
\p
\v 25 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know not whence ye are:
\p
\v 26 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
\p
\v 27 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all \add ye\add* workers of iniquity.
\p
\v 28 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you \add yourselves\add* thrust out.
\p
\v 29 And they shall come from the east, and \add from\add* the west, and from the north, and \add from\add* the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 30 And, behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.
\p
\v 31 ¶ The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.
\p
\v 32 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third \add day\add* I shall be perfected.
\p
\v 33 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the \add day\add* following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen \add doth gather\add* her brood under \add her\add* wings, and ye would not!
\p
\v 35 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until \add the time\add* come when ye shall say, Blessed \add is\add* he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
\c 14
\cl CHAPTER 14
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.
\p
\v 2 And, behold, there was a certain man before him who had the dropsy.
\p
\v 3 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?
\p
\v 4 And they held their peace. And he took \add him,\add* and healed him, and let him go;
\p
\v 5 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?
\p
\v 6 And they could not answer him again to these things.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And he put forth a parable to those that were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,
\p
\v 8 When thou art bidden of any \add man\add* to a wedding, sit not down in the highest seat; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;
\p
\v 9 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest seat.
\p
\v 10 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest seat; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have honour in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.
\p
\v 11 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor \add thy\add* rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.
\p
\v 13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:
\p
\v 14 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed \add is\add* he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:
\p
\v 17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.
\p
\v 18 And they all with one \add consent\add* began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.
\p
\v 19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.
\p
\v 20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
\p
\v 21 So that servant came, and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
\p
\v 22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.
\p
\v 23 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel \add them\add* to come in, that my house may be filled.
\p
\v 24 For I say unto you, That none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper.
\p
\v 25 ¶ And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,
\p
\v 26 If any \add man\add* come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
\p
\v 27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.
\p
\v 28 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have \add sufficient\add*  to finish \add it?\add* 
\p
\v 29 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish \add it,\add* all that behold \add it\add* begin to mock him,
\p
\v 30 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
\p
\v 31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?
\p
\v 32 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.
\p
\v 33 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.
\p
\v 34 ¶ Salt \add is\add* good: but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
\p
\v 35 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; \add but\add* men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\c 15
\cl CHAPTER 15
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners to hear him.
\p
\v 2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
\p
\v 3 ¶ And he spake this parable unto them, saying,
\p
\v 4 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
\p
\v 5 And when he hath found \add it,\add* he layeth \add it\add* on his shoulders, rejoicing.
\p
\v 6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together \add his\add*  friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.
\p
\v 7 I say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, who need no repentance.
\p
\v 8 ¶ Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find \add it?\add*
\p
\v 9 And when she hath found \add it,\add* she calleth \add her\add* friends and \add her\add* neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.
\p
\v 10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And he said, A certain man had two sons:
\p
\v 12 And the younger of them said to \add his\add* father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth \add to me.\add*  And he divided unto them \add his\add* living.
\p
\v 13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.
\p
\v 14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
\p
\v 15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
\p
\v 16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
\p
\v 17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!
\p
\v 18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
\p
\v 19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
\p
\v 20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
\p
\v 21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.
\p
\v 22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put \add it\add* on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on \add his\add* feet:
\p
\v 23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill \add it;\add*  and let us eat, and be merry:
\p
\v 24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
\p
\v 25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.
\p
\v 26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
\p
\v 27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.
\p
\v 28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and entreated him.
\p
\v 29 And he answering said to \add his\add* father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
\p
\v 30 But as soon as this thy son was come, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.
\p
\v 31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.
\p
\v 32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.
\c 16
\cl CHAPTER 16
\p
\v 1 ¶ And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.
\p
\v 2 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.
\p
\v 3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I am not strong enough to dig; to beg I am ashamed.
\p
\v 4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
\p
\v 5 So he called every one of his lord’s debtors \add unto him,\add* and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?
\p
\v 6 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
\p
\v 7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.
\p
\v 8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.
\p
\v 9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.
\p
\v 10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.
\p
\v 11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true \add riches?\add* 
\p
\v 12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?
\p
\v 13 ¶ No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
\p
\v 14 And the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
\p
\v 15 And he said unto them, Ye are they who justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.
\p
\v 16 The law and the prophets \add were\add* until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.
\p
\v 17 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.
\p
\v 18 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from \add her\add* husband committeth adultery.
\p
\v 19 ¶ There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
\p
\v 20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores,
\p
\v 21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
\p
\v 22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
\p
\v 23 And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
\p
\v 24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
\p
\v 25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
\p
\v 26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they who would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that \add would come\add* from thence.
\p
\v 27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:
\p
\v 28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
\p
\v 29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
\p
\v 30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
\p
\v 31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
\c 17
\cl CHAPTER 17
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe \add unto him,\add* through whom they come!
\p
\v 2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
\p
\v 3 ¶ Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
\p
\v 4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
\p
\v 5 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
\p
\v 6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you.
\p
\v 7 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?
\p
\v 8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
\p
\v 9 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.
\p
\v 10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which it was our duty to do.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
\p
\v 12 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off:
\p
\v 13 And they lifted up \add their\add* voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
\p
\v 14 And when he saw \add them,\add* he said unto them, Go show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.
\p
\v 15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
\p
\v 16 And fell down on \add his\add* face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
\p
\v 17 And Jesus answering said, Were not ten cleansed? but where \add are\add* the nine?
\p
\v 18 Was none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger?
\p
\v 19 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with outward show:
\p
\v 21 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.
\p
\v 22 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 23 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after \add them,\add* nor follow \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 24 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one \add part\add* under heaven, shineth unto the other \add part\add*  under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.
\p
\v 25 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.
\p
\v 26 And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
\p
\v 27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
\p
\v 28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
\p
\v 29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from the heavens, and destroyed \add them\add* all.
\p
\v 30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
\p
\v 31 In that day, he that shall be upon the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.
\p
\v 32 Remember Lot’s wife.
\p
\v 33 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.
\p
\v 34 I tell you, in that night there shall be two \add men\add* in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
\p
\v 35 Two \add women\add* shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
\p
\v 36 Two \add men\add* shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
\p
\v 37 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them,  Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.
\c 18
\cl CHAPTER 18
\p
\v 1 ¶ And he spake a parable unto them \add to this end,\add* that they ought always to pray, and not to faint;
\p
\v 2 Saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not God, neither regarded man:
\p
\v 3 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
\p
\v 4 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
\p
\v 5 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.
\p
\v 6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
\p
\v 7 And shall not God avenge his own elect, who cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?
\p
\v 8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find the faith on the earth?
\p
\v 9 And he spake this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
\p
\v 10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
\p
\v 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men \add are,\add* extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
\p
\v 12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I gain.
\p
\v 13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as \add his\add* eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
\p
\v 14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified \add rather\add* than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
\p
\v 15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when \add his\add* disciples saw \add it,\add* they rebuked them.
\p
\v 16 But Jesus called them \add unto him,\add* and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.
\p
\v 18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
\p
\v 19 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none \add is\add* good, save one, \add that is,\add* God.
\p
\v 20 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.
\p
\v 21 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
\p
\v 22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
\p
\v 23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
\p
\v 24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
\p
\v 25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 26 And they that heard \add it\add* said, Who then can be saved?
\p
\v 27 And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
\p
\v 28 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
\p
\v 29 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,
\p
\v 30 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
\p
\v 31 ¶ Then he took \add unto him\add* the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.
\p
\v 32 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spat upon:
\p
\v 33 And they shall scourge \add him,\add* and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.
\p
\v 34 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
\p
\v 35 ¶ And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
\p
\v 36 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
\p
\v 37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
\p
\v 38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, \add thou\add* son of David, have mercy on me.
\p
\v 39 And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, \add Thou\add* son of David, have mercy on me.
\p
\v 40 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
\p
\v 41 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
\p
\v 42 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.
\p
\v 43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw \add it,\add* gave praise unto God.
\c 19
\cl CHAPTER 19
\p
\v 1 ¶ And \add Jesus,\add* having entered, was passing through Jericho.
\p
\v 2 And, behold, \add there was\add* a man named Zacchaeus, who was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.
\p
\v 3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.
\p
\v 4 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him: for he was to pass that \add way.\add* 
\p
\v 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.
\p
\v 6 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
\p
\v 7 And when they saw \add it,\add* they all murmured, saying, He has gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
\p
\v 8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore \add him\add* fourfold.
\p
\v 9 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.
\p
\v 10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
\p
\v 11 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.
\p
\v 12 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
\p
\v 13 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade till I come.
\p
\v 14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this \add man\add* to reign over us.
\p
\v 15 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.
\p
\v 16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.
\p
\v 17 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.
\p
\v 18 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.
\p
\v 19 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.
\p
\v 20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, \add here is\add*  thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:
\p
\v 21 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.
\p
\v 22 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, \add thou\add* wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow;
\p
\v 23 Then why gavest thou not my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with interest?
\p
\v 24 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give \add it\add* to him that hath ten pounds.
\p
\v 25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)
\p
\v 26 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.
\p
\v 27 But these mine enemies, who would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay \add them\add* before me.
\p
\v 28 ¶ And when he had thus spoken, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called \add the mount\add* of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
\p
\v 30 Saying, Go ye into the village over against \add you;\add* in which at the entrance ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring \add him hither.\add* 
\p
\v 31 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose \add him?\add* thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of it.
\p
\v 32 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.
\p
\v 33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?
\p
\v 34 And they said, The Lord hath need of it.
\p
\v 35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.
\p
\v 36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
\p
\v 37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;
\p
\v 38 Saying, Blessed \add be\add* the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
\p
\v 39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
\p
\v 40 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.
\p
\v 41 ¶ And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
\p
\v 42 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things \add which belong\add* unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.
\p
\v 43 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,
\p
\v 44 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
\p
\v 45 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out those that sold therein, and those that bought;
\p
\v 46 Saying unto them, It is written, My house shall be the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers.
\p
\v 47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,
\p
\v 48 And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
\c 20
\cl CHAPTER 20
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass, on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon \add him\add* with the elders,
\p
\v 2 And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?
\p
\v 3 And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:
\p
\v 4 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?
\p
\v 5 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
\p
\v 6 But if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
\p
\v 7 And they answered, that they could not tell whence \add it was.\add* 
\p
\v 8 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
\p
\v 9 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.
\p
\v 10 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent \add him\add* away empty.
\p
\v 11 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and treated \add him\add* shamefully, and sent \add him\add*  away empty.
\p
\v 12 And he even sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast \add him\add* out.
\p
\v 13 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence \add him\add* when they see him.
\p
\v 14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
\p
\v 15 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed \add him.\add* What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?
\p
\v 16 He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard \add it,\add* they said, God forbid.
\p
\v 17 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same became the head of the corner?
\p
\v 18 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.
\p
\v 20 And they watched \add him,\add* and sent forth spies, that should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.
\p
\v 21 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person \add of any,\add* but really teachest the way of God:
\p
\v 22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?
\p
\v 23 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?
\p
\v 24 Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They, answering, said, Caesar’s.
\p
\v 25 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.
\p
\v 26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
\p
\v 27 ¶ Then came to \add him\add* certain of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,
\p
\v 28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
\p
\v 29 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.
\p
\v 30 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
\p
\v 31 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.
\p
\v 32 Last of all the woman died also.
\p
\v 33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.
\p
\v 34 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
\p
\v 35 But they that shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
\p
\v 36 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
\p
\v 37 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
\p
\v 38 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.
\p
\v 39 ¶ Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.
\p
\v 40 And after that they durst not ask him any \add question at all.\add* 
\p
\v 41 And he said unto them, How say they that the Christ is David’s son?
\p
\v 42 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
\p
\v 43 Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
\p
\v 44 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?
\p
\v 45 ¶ Then in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples,
\p
\v 46 Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief seats at feasts;
\p
\v 47 Who devour widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater condemnation.
\c 21
\cl CHAPTER 21
\p
\v 1 ¶ And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
\p
\v 2 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
\p
\v 3 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:
\p
\v 4 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
\p
\v 6 \add As for\add* these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
\p
\v 7 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign \add will there be\add* when these things are about to come to pass?
\p
\v 8 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am \add Christ;\add* and, The time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.
\p
\v 9 And, when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end \add is\add* not immediately.
\p
\v 10 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
\p
\v 11 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.
\p
\v 12 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute \add you,\add* delivering \add you\add* up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake.
\p
\v 13 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
\p
\v 14 Settle \add it\add* therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:
\p
\v 15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
\p
\v 16 And ye shall be delivered up both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and \add some\add* of you shall they cause to be put to death.
\p
\v 17 And ye shall be hated of all \add men\add* for my name’s sake.
\p
\v 18 But there shall not a hair of your head perish.
\p
\v 19 In your patience possess ye your souls.
\p
\v 20 And when ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.
\p
\v 21 Then let them that are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them that are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.
\p
\v 22 For those will be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
\p
\v 23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.
\p
\v 24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
\p
\v 25 ¶ And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity because of the sea and the waves roaring;
\p
\v 26 Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking forward to those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
\p
\v 27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
\p
\v 28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.
\p
\v 29 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;
\p
\v 30 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh.
\p
\v 31 So likewise ye, when ye see these things being fulfilled, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh.
\p
\v 32 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.
\p
\v 33 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
\p
\v 34 ¶ And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unexpectedly.
\p
\v 35 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
\p
\v 36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
\p
\v 37 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called \add the mount\add* of Olives.
\p
\v 38 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.
\c 22
\cl CHAPTER 22
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
\p
\v 2 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
\p
\v 3 ¶ Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
\p
\v 4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.
\p
\v 5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
\p
\v 6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
\p
\v 8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.
\p
\v 9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
\p
\v 10 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.
\p
\v 11 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
\p
\v 12 And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
\p
\v 13 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
\p
\v 14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
\p
\v 15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
\p
\v 16 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide \add it\add* among yourselves:
\p
\v 18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake \add it,\add* and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
\p
\v 20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup \add is\add* the new covenant in my blood, which is shed for you.
\p
\v 21 ¶ But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me \add is\add* with me on the table.
\p
\v 22 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!
\p
\v 23 And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greater.
\p
\v 25 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority over them are called benefactors.
\p
\v 26 But ye \add shall\add* not \add be\add* so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
\p
\v 27 For which \add is\add* greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? \add is\add* not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.
\p
\v 28 Ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations.
\p
\v 29 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;
\p
\v 30 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 31 ¶ And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired \add to have\add* you, that he might sift \add you\add* as wheat:
\p
\v 32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou hast turned again, strengthen thy brethren.
\p
\v 33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.
\p
\v 34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, before the cock shall crow this day, thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
\p
\v 35 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.
\p
\v 36 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take \add it,\add* and likewise \add his\add* bag: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.
\p
\v 37 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.
\p
\v 38 And they said, Lord, behold, here \add are\add* two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.
\p
\v 39 ¶ And he came out, and went, as was his custom, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
\p
\v 40 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
\p
\v 41 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
\p
\v 42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
\p
\v 43 And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
\p
\v 44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
\p
\v 45 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,
\p
\v 46 And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
\p
\v 47 ¶ And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.
\p
\v 48 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
\p
\v 49 When they that were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
\p
\v 50 ¶ And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
\p
\v 51 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.
\p
\v 52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, that were come upon him, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves?
\p
\v 53 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
\p
\v 54 ¶ Then took they him, and led \add him,\add* and brought him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed afar off.
\p
\v 55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
\p
\v 56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
\p
\v 57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
\p
\v 58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
\p
\v 59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this \add fellow\add* also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.
\p
\v 60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
\p
\v 61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow this day, thou shalt deny me thrice.
\p
\v 62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
\p
\v 63 ¶ And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote \add him.\add* 
\p
\v 64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
\p
\v 65 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
\p
\v 66 ¶ And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,
\p
\v 67 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:
\p
\v 68 And if I also ask \add you,\add* ye will not answer me, nor let \add me\add* go.
\p
\v 69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
\p
\v 70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say it, I am.
\p
\v 71 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard out of his own mouth.
\c 23
\cl CHAPTER 23
\p
\v 1 ¶ And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
\p
\v 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this \add fellow\add* perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
\p
\v 3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.
\p
\v 4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and \add to\add* the people, I find no fault in this man.
\p
\v 5 And they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea; beginning from Galilee to this place.
\p
\v 6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
\p
\v 7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he had long been desirous to see him, because he had heard many things about him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.
\p
\v 9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
\p
\v 10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
\p
\v 11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked \add him,\add* and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the same day Pilate and Herod became friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
\p
\v 14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined \add him\add* before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
\p
\v 15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
\p
\v 16 I will therefore chastise him, and release \add him.\add* 
\p
\v 17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
\p
\v 18 And they cried out all together, saying, Away with this \add man,\add* and release unto us Barabbas:
\p
\v 19 (Who for a certain uprising made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
\p
\v 20 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
\p
\v 21 But they cried, saying, Crucify \add him,\add* crucify him.
\p
\v 22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let \add him\add* go.
\p
\v 23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.
\p
\v 24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
\p
\v 25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
\p
\v 26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear \add it\add* after Jesus.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who bewailed and lamented him.
\p
\v 28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
\p
\v 29 For, behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed \add are\add* the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts which never gave suck.
\p
\v 30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
\p
\v 31 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
\p
\v 32 And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
\p
\v 33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
\p
\v 34 ¶ Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
\p
\v 35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided \add him,\add* saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ, the chosen of God.
\p
\v 36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
\p
\v 37 And saying, If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.
\p
\v 38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\p
\v 39 ¶ And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
\p
\v 40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
\p
\v 41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
\p
\v 42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
\p
\v 43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
\p
\v 44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
\p
\v 45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
\p
\v 46 ¶ And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up his spirit.
\p
\v 47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
\p
\v 48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
\p
\v 49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
\p
\v 50 ¶ And, behold, \add there was\add* a man named Joseph, a councillor; \add and he was\add* a good man, and a just:
\p
\v 51 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) \add he was\add* of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 52 This \add man\add* went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
\p
\v 53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
\p
\v 54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
\p
\v 55 And the women also, who came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
\p
\v 56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
\c 24
\cl CHAPTER 24
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now upon the first \add day\add* of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain \add others\add* with them.
\p
\v 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
\p
\v 3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
\p
\v 5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down \add their\add* faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
\p
\v 6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
\p
\v 7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
\p
\v 8 And they remembered his words,
\p
\v 9 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
\p
\v 10 It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary \add the mother\add* of James, and other \add women that were\add* with them, who told these things unto the apostles.
\p
\v 11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
\p
\v 12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen cloths laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem \add about\add* threescore furlongs.
\p
\v 14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
\p
\v 15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed \add together\add* and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
\p
\v 16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
\p
\v 17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications \add are\add* these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
\p
\v 18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
\p
\v 19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
\p
\v 20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
\p
\v 21 But we trusted that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
\p
\v 22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, who were early at the sepulchre;
\p
\v 23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
\p
\v 24 And certain of them that were with us went to the sepulchre, and found \add it\add* even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
\p
\v 25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
\p
\v 26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
\p
\v 27 And beginning from Moses and out of all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
\p
\v 28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would go further.
\p
\v 29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
\p
\v 30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed \add it,\add* and brake, and gave to them.
\p
\v 31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
\p
\v 32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
\p
\v 33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
\p
\v 34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
\p
\v 35 And they told what things \add were done\add* in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace \add be\add* unto you.
\p
\v 37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
\p
\v 38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
\p
\v 39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
\p
\v 40 And when he had thus spoken, he showed them \add his\add* hands and \add his\add* feet.
\p
\v 41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any food?
\p
\v 42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
\p
\v 43 And he took \add it,\add* and did eat before them.
\p
\v 44 And he said unto them, These \add are\add* the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and \add in\add* the prophets, and \add in\add* the psalms, concerning me.
\p
\v 45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
\p
\v 46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
\p
\v 47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
\p
\v 48 And ye are witnesses of these things.
\p
\v 49 ¶ And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
\p
\v 50 ¶ And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
\p
\v 51 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
\p
\v 52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
\p
\v 53 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
\p
\v 2 The same was in the beginning with God.
\p
\v 3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
\p
\v 4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
\p
\v 5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
\p
\v 6 ¶ There was a man sent from God, whose name \add was\add* John.
\p
\v 7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all \add men\add* through him might believe.
\p
\v 8 He was not that Light, but \add was sent\add* to bear witness of that Light.
\p
\v 9 The true Light was he who, coming into the world, enlighteneth every man.
\p
\v 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
\p
\v 11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
\p
\v 12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the children of God, \add even\add* to them that believe on his name:
\p
\v 13 Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
\p
\v 14 And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
\p
\v 15 ¶ John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.
\p
\v 16 And of his fulness have all we received, and grace upon grace.
\p
\v 17 For the law was given by Moses, \add but\add* grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 18 No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared \add him\add*.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?
\p
\v 20 And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.
\p
\v 21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.
\p
\v 22 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
\p
\v 23 He said, I \add am\add* the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.
\p
\v 24 And they that were sent were of the Pharisees.
\p
\v 25 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not the Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?
\p
\v 26 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
\p
\v 27 He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, the cord of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose.
\p
\v 28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
\p
\v 29 ¶ The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.
\p
\v 30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is preferred before me: for he was before me.
\p
\v 31 And I knew him not: but to the end that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
\p
\v 32 And John bare witness, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
\p
\v 33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 34 And I saw, and bare witness that this is the Son of God.
\p
\v 35 ¶ Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
\p
\v 36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!
\p
\v 37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
\p
\v 38 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?
\p
\v 39 He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.
\p
\v 40 One of the two who heard John \add speak,\add* and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
\p
\v 41 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
\p
\v 42 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.
\p
\v 43 ¶ The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.
\p
\v 44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
\p
\v 45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
\p
\v 46 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
\p
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
\p
\v 48 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
\p
\v 49 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
\p
\v 50 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.
\p
\v 51 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
\p
\v 2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
\p
\v 3 And when they lacked wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
\p
\v 4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
\p
\v 5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do \add it. \add*
\p
\v 6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
\p
\v 7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
\p
\v 8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare \add it. \add*
\p
\v 9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants who drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
\p
\v 10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: \add but\add* thou hast kept the good wine until now.
\p
\v 11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
\p
\v 12 ¶ After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
\p
\v 14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: 
\p 
\v 15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;
\p
\v 16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.
\p
\v 17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
\p
\v 19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
\p
\v 20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
\p
\v 21 But he spake of the temple of his body.
\p
\v 22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
\p
\v 23 ¶ Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast \add day, \add* many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
\p
\v 24 But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all \add men,\add*
\p
\v 25 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
\p
\v 2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
\p
\v 3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?
\p
\v 5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and \add of\add* the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
\p
\v 7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
\p
\v 8 The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
\p
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
\p
\v 10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?
\p
\v 11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
\p
\v 12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you heavenly things?
\p
\v 13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, \add even\add* the Son of man who is in heaven.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
\p
\v 15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
\p
\v 16 ¶ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
\p
\v 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
\p
\v 18 ¶ He that believeth on him is not judged: but he that believeth not is judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
\p
\v 19 And this is the judgment, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
\p
\v 20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
\p
\v 21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
\p
\v 22 ¶ After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
\p
\v 24 For John was not yet cast into prison.
\p
\v 25 ¶ Then there arose a question between \add some\add* of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.
\p
\v 26 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all \add men\add* come to him.
\p
\v 27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
\p
\v 28 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
\p
\v 29 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
\p
\v 30 He must increase, but I \add must\add* decrease.
\p
\v 31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.
\p
\v 32 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.
\p
\v 33 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.
\p
\v 34 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure.
\p
\v 35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
\p 
\v 36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
\p
\v 2 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
\p
\v 3 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
\p
\v 4 And he must needs go through Samaria.
\p
\v 5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
\p
\v 6 Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with \add his\add* journey, sat thus on the well: \add and\add* it was about the sixth hour.
\p
\v 7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
\p
\v 8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy food.)
\p
\v 9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? (For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.)
\p
\v 10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
\p
\v 11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
\p
\v 12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
\p
\v 13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
\p
\v 14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.
\p
\v 15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
\p
\v 16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
\p
\v 17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
\p
\v 18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
\p
\v 19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
\p
\v 20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
\p
\v 21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
\p
\v 22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
\p
\v 23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
\p
\v 24 God \add is\add* a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship \add him\add* in spirit and in truth.
\p
\v 25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, who is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
\p
\v 26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am \add he\add*.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with a woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
\p
\v 28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
\p
\v 29 Come, see a man, who told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
\p
\v 30 Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
\p
\v 31 ¶ In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
\p
\v 32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
\p
\v 33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him \add aught\add* to eat?
\p
\v 34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
\p
\v 35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and \add then\add* cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
\p
\v 36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
\p
\v 37 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
\p
\v 38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.
\p
\v 39 ¶ And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, who testified, He told me all that ever I did.
\p
\v 40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
\p
\v 41 And many more believed because of his own word;
\p
\v 42 And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard \add him\add* ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
\p
\v 43 ¶ Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
\p
\v 44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
\p
\v 45 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
\p
\v 46 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
\p
\v 47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
\p
\v 48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
\p
\v 49 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
\p
\v 50 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
\p
\v 51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told \add him,\add* saying, Thy son liveth.
\p
\v 52 Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him. Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
\p
\v 53 So the father knew that \add it was\add* at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
\p
\v 54 This \add is\add* again the second miracle \add that\add* Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep \add market\add* a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
\p
\v 3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
\p
\v 4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
\p
\v 5 And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
\p
\v 6 When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time \add in that state,\add* he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
\p
\v 7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
\p
\v 8 Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
\p
\v 9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
\p
\v 10 ¶ The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry \add thy\add* bed.
\p
\v 11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
\p
\v 12 Then asked they him, What man is that who said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
\p
\v 13 And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in \add that\add* place.
\p
\v 14 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest something worse come unto thee.
\p
\v 15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, who had made him whole.
\p
\v 16 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
\p
\v 17 ¶ But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
\p
\v 18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God.
\p
\v 19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.
\p
\v 20 For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and he will show him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.
\p
\v 21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth them life; even so the Son giveth life to whom he will.
\p
\v 22 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:
\p
\v 23 That all \add men\add* should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father who hath sent him.
\p
\v 24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment; but is passed from death unto life.
\p
\v 25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
\p
\v 26 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;
\p
\v 27 And hath given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man.
\p
\v 28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
\p
\v 29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.
\p
\v 30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father who hath sent me.
\p
\v 31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
\p
\v 32 ¶ There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
\p
\v 33 Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
\p
\v 34 But I receive not witness from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.
\p
\v 35 He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
\p
\v 36 ¶ But I have greater witness than \add that\add* of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
\p
\v 37 And the Father himself, who hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
\p
\v 38 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
\p
\v 39 ¶ Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
\p
\v 40 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
\p
\v 41 I receive not honour from men.
\p
\v 42 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
\p
\v 43 I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
\p
\v 44 How can ye believe, who receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that \add cometh\add* from God only?
\p
\v 45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is \add one\add* that accuseth you, \add even\add* Moses, in whom ye trust.
\p
\v 46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.
\p
\v 47 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is \add the sea\add* of Tiberias.
\p
\v 2 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
\p
\v 3 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
\p
\v 4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
\p
\v 5 ¶ When Jesus then lifted up \add his\add* eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
\p
\v 6 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
\p
\v 7 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
\p
\v 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,
\p
\v 9 There is a lad here, who hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
\p
\v 10 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
\p
\v 11 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
\p
\v 12 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
\p
\v 13 Therefore they gathered \add them\add* together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.
\p
\v 14 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.
\p
\v 15 ¶ When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
\p
\v 16 And when even was \add now\add* come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
\p
\v 17 And entered into a boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not yet come to them.
\p
\v 18 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
\p
\v 19 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat: and they were afraid.
\p
\v 20 But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
\p
\v 21 Then they willingly received him into the boat: and immediately the boat was at the land whither they went.
\p
\v 22 ¶ The day following, when the people who stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but \add that\add* his disciples were gone away alone;
\p
\v 23 (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)
\p
\v 24 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
\p
\v 25 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
\p
\v 26 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
\p
\v 27 Labour not for the food which perisheth, but for that food which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.
\p
\v 28 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?
\p
\v 29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
\p
\v 30 They said therefore unto him, What sign showest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?
\p
\v 31 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
\p
\v 32 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.
\p
\v 33 For the bread of God is he who cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.
\p
\v 34 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
\p
\v 35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
\p
\v 36 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.
\p
\v 37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
\p
\v 38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
\p
\v 39 And this is the Father’s will who hath sent me, that of all that he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
\p
\v 40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
\p
\v 41 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.
\p
\v 42 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?
\p
\v 43 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.
\p
\v 44 No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
\p
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.
\p
\v 46 Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he that is of God, he hath seen the Father.
\p
\v 47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.
\p
\v 48 I am that bread of life.
\p
\v 49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
\p
\v 50 This is the bread that cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
\p
\v 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
\p
\v 52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us \add his\add* flesh to eat?
\p
\v 53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
\p
\v 54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
\p
\v 55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
\p
\v 56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
\p
\v 57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.
\p
\v 58 This is that bread that came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.
\p
\v 59 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
\p
\v 60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard \add this, \add* said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?
\p
\v 61 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?
\p
\v 62 \add What\add* and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?
\p
\v 63 It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, \add they\add* are spirit, and \add they\add* are life.
\p
\v 64 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.
\p
\v 65 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.
\p
\v 66 ¶ From that \add time\add* many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
\p
\v 67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?
\p
\v 68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.
\p
\v 69 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.
\p
\v 70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
\p
\v 71 He spake of Judas Iscariot \add the son\add* of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.
\c 7
\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 ¶ After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
\p
\v 2 Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.
\p
\v 3 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
\p
\v 4 For \add there is\add* no man \add that\add* doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, show thyself to the world.
\p
\v 5 For neither did his brethren believe in him.
\p
\v 6 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
\p
\v 7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
\p
\v 8 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet fully come.
\p
\v 9 When he had said these words unto them, he abode \add still\add* in Galilee.
\p
\v 10 ¶ But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
\p
\v 11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
\p
\v 12 And there was much debate among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
\p
\v 13 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
\p
\v 14 ¶ Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
\p
\v 15 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
\p
\v 16 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
\p
\v 17 If any man doth do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or \add whether\add* I speak of myself.
\p
\v 18 He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
\p
\v 19 Did not Moses give you the law, and \add yet\add* none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?
\p
\v 20 The multitude answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who goeth about to kill thee?
\p
\v 21 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
\p
\v 22 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
\p
\v 23 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
\p
\v 24 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
\p
\v 25 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
\p
\v 26 But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
\p
\v 27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
\p
\v 28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
\p
\v 29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
\p
\v 30 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
\p
\v 31 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When the Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this \add man\add* hath done?
\p
\v 32 ¶ The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
\p
\v 33 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and \add then\add* I go unto him that sent me.
\p
\v 34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find \add me:\add* and where I am, \add thither\add* ye cannot come.
\p
\v 35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
\p
\v 36 What \add manner of\add* saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find \add me:\add* and where I am, \add thither \add* ye cannot come?
\p
\v 37 In the last day, that great \add day\add* of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
\p
\v 38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.
\p
\v 39 (But this spake he of the Spirit, whom they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Spirit was not yet \add given;\add* because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
\p
\v 40 ¶ Some of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
\p
\v 41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall the Christ come out of Galilee?
\p
\v 42 Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
\p
\v 43 So there was a division among the people because of him.
\p
\v 44 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
\p
\v 45 ¶ Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
\p
\v 46 The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
\p
\v 47 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
\p
\v 48 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
\p
\v 49 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
\p
\v 50 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
\p
\v 51 Doth our law judge \add any\add* man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
\p
\v 52 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
\p
\v 53 And every man went unto his own house.
\c 8
\cl CHAPTER 8
\p
\v 1 ¶ Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
\p
\v 2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
\p
\v 3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
\p
\v 4 They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
\p
\v 5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?
\p
\v 6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with \add his\add* finger wrote on the ground.
\p
\v 7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
\p
\v 8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
\p
\v 9 And they that heard \add it,\add* being convicted by \add their own \add* conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, \add even \add* unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
\p
\v 10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
\p
\v 11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
\p
\v 13 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.
\p
\v 14 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear witness of myself, \add yet\add* my witness is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.
\p
\v 15 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
\p 
\v 16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
\p
\v 17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.
\p
\v 18 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.
\p
\v 19 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.
\p
\v 20 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
\p
\v 21 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.
\p
\v 22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.
\p
\v 23 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
\p
\v 24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am \add he,\add* ye shall die in your sins.
\p
\v 25 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even \add the same\add* that I said unto you from the beginning.
\p
\v 26 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.
\p
\v 27 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
\p
\v 28 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am \add he,\add* and \add that\add* I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
\p
\v 29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
\p
\v 30 As he spake these words, many believed on him.
\p
\v 31 Then said Jesus to those Jews that believed on him, If ye continue in my word, \add then\add* are ye my disciples indeed;
\p
\v 32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
\p
\v 33 ¶ They answered him, We are Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.
\p
\v 35 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: \add but \add* the Son abideth ever.
\p
\v 36 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
\p
\v 37 I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.
\p
\v 38 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
\p
\v 39 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
\p
\v 40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.
\p
\v 41 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one Father, \add even\add* God.
\p
\v 42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.
\p
\v 43 Why do ye not understand my speech? \add even\add* because ye cannot hear my word.
\p
\v 44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the wishes of \add your \add* father ye will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
\p
\v 45 And because I tell \add you\add* the truth, ye believe me not.
\p
\v 46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?
\p
\v 47 He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear \add them \add* not, because ye are not of God.
\p
\v 48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?
\p
\v 49 Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.
\p
\v 50 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
\p
\v 51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
\p
\v 52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.
\p
\v 53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?
\p
\v 54 Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:
\p
\v 55 Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.
\p
\v 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw, and was glad.
\p
\v 57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
\p
\v 58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.
\p
\v 59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
\c 9
\cl CHAPTER 9
\p
\v 1 ¶ And as he passed by, he saw a man who was blind from birth.
\p
\v 2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
\p
\v 3 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
\p
\v 4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
\p
\v 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
\p
\v 6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
\p
\v 7 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
\p
\v 8 ¶ The neighbours therefore, and they that before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
\p
\v 9 Some said, This is he: others \add said,\add* He is like him: \add but \add* he said, I am \add he. \add*
\p
\v 10 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
\p
\v 11 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
\p
\v 12 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
\p
\v 13 ¶ They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
\p
\v 14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
\p
\v 15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
\p
\v 16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
\p
\v 17 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, now that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
\p
\v 18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
\p
\v 19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
\p
\v 20 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
\p
\v 21 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
\p
\v 22 These \add words\add* spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
\p
\v 23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
\p
\v 24 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
\p
\v 25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner \add or no,\add* I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
\p
\v 26 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
\p
\v 27 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear \add it\add* again? will ye also be his disciples?
\p
\v 28 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.
\p
\v 29 We know that God spake unto Moses: \add as for\add* this \add fellow, \add* we know not from whence he is.
\p
\v 30 The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and \add yet\add* he hath opened mine eyes.
\p
\v 31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
\p
\v 32 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
\p
\v 33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
\p
\v 34 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
\p
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
\p
\v 36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
\p
\v 37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
\p
\v 38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
\p
\v 39 ¶ And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they that see not might see; and that they that see might be made blind.
\p
\v 40 And \add some\add* of the Pharisees that were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?
\p
\v 41 Jesus said unto them. If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.
\c 10
\cl CHAPTER 10
\p
\v 1 ¶ Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
\p
\v 2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
\p
\v 3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
\p
\v 4 And when he putteth forth all his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
\p
\v 5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
\p
\v 6 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
\p
\v 7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
\p
\v 8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
\p
\v 9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
\p
\v 10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have \add it \add* more abundantly.
\p
\v 11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
\p
\v 12 But he that is an hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
\p
\v 13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
\p
\v 14 I am the good shepherd, and know my \add sheep,\add* and am known of mine.
\p
\v 15 Even as the Father knoweth me and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
\p
\v 16 And other sheep I have, that are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, \add and\add* one shepherd.
\p
\v 17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
\p
\v 18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.
\p
\v 19 ¶ There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
\p
\v 20 And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?
\p
\v 21 Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
\p
\v 22 ¶ And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
\p
\v 23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.
\p
\v 24 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.
\p
\v 25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.
\p
\v 26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.
\p
\v 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
\p
\v 28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any \add man\add* pluck them out of my hand.
\p
\v 29 My Father, who gave \add them\add* me, is greater than all; and no \add man\add* is able to pluck \add them\add* out of my Father’s hand.
\p
\v 30 I and \add my\add* Father are one.
\p
\v 31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
\p
\v 32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shown you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
\p
\v 33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
\p
\v 35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
\p
\v 36 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?
\p
\v 37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
\p
\v 38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.
\p
\v 39 Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
\p
\v 40 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.
\p
\v 41 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.
\p
\v 42 And many believed on him there.
\c 11
\cl CHAPTER 11
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now a certain \add man\add* was sick, \add named\add* Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
\p
\v 2 (It was \add that\add* Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
\p
\v 3 Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
\p
\v 4 When Jesus heard \add that,\add* he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.
\p
\v 5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
\p
\v 6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
\p
\v 7 Then after that saith he to \add his\add* disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
\p
\v 8 \add His\add* disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
\p
\v 9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
\p
\v 10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.
\p
\v 11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus hath fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
\p
\v 12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
\p
\v 13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest in sleep.
\p
\v 14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
\p
\v 15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.
\p
\v 16 Then said Thomas, who is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
\p
\v 17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had \add lain\add* in the grave four days already.
\p
\v 18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
\p
\v 19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
\p
\v 20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat \add still\add* in the house.
\p
\v 21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
\p
\v 22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give \add it\add* thee.
\p
\v 23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
\p
\v 24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
\p
\v 25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
\p
\v 26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
\p
\v 27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world.
\p
\v 28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.
\p
\v 29 As soon as she heard \add that,\add* she arose quickly, and came unto him.
\p
\v 30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.
\p
\v 31 The Jews then that were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.
\p
\v 32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
\p
\v 33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
\p
\v 34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.
\p
\v 35 Jesus wept.
\p
\v 36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
\p
\v 37 And some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
\p
\v 38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
\p
\v 39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been \add dead\add* four days.
\p
\v 40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
\p
\v 41 Then they took away the stone \add from the place\add* where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up \add his\add* eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
\p
\v 42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people that stand by I said \add it,\add* that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
\p
\v 43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
\p
\v 44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
\p
\v 45 Then many of the Jews that came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.
\p
\v 46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
\p
\v 47 ¶ Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.
\p
\v 48 If we let him thus alone, all \add men\add* will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.
\p
\v 49 And one of them, \add named\add* Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,
\p
\v 50 Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
\p
\v 51 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
\p
\v 52 And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
\p
\v 53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.
\p
\v 54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a town called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
\p
\v 55 ¶ And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.
\p
\v 56 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?
\p
\v 57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show \add it,\add* that they might take him.
\c 12
\cl CHAPTER 12
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
\p
\v 2 There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
\p
\v 3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
\p
\v 4 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s \add son, \add* who should betray him,
\p
\v 5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
\p
\v 6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare away what was put therein.
\p
\v 7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.
\p
\v 8 For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.
\p
\v 9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
\p
\v 10 ¶ But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
\p
\v 11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
\p
\v 12 ¶ On the next day many people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
\p
\v 13 Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed \add is\add* the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.
\p
\v 14 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
\p
\v 15 Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.
\p
\v 16 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and \add that\add* they had done these things unto him.
\p
\v 17 The people therefore that were with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.
\p
\v 18 For this cause the people also met him, because they heard that he had done this miracle.
\p
\v 19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:
\p
\v 21 The same came therefore to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
\p
\v 22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
\p
\v 24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
\p
\v 25 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
\p
\v 26 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will \add my\add* Father honour.
\p
\v 27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
\p
\v 28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, \add saying,\add* I have both glorified \add it,\add* and will glorify \add it\add* again.
\p
\v 29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard \add it,\add* said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.
\p
\v 30 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
\p
\v 31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
\p
\v 32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all \add men \add* unto me.
\p
\v 33 This he said, signifying what death he should die.
\p
\v 34 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
\p
\v 35 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
\p
\v 36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
\p
\v 37 ¶ But though he had done so many miracles before them, they believed not on him:
\p
\v 38 That the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
\p
\v 39 Therefore they could not believe, because that Isaiah said again,
\p
\v 40 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with \add their\add* eyes, nor understand with \add their\add* heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
\p
\v 41 These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
\p
\v 42 ¶ Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess \add him,\add* lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
\p
\v 43 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
\p
\v 44 ¶ Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
\p
\v 45 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
\p
\v 46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
\p
\v 47 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
\p
\v 48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
\p
\v 49 For I have not spoken out of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
\p
\v 50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.
\c 13
\cl CHAPTER 13
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
\p
\v 2 And while they were at supper, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s \add son,\add* to betray him;
\p
\v 3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
\p
\v 4 He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
\p
\v 5 After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe \add them\add* with the towel wherewith he was girded.
\p
\v 6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
\p
\v 7 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
\p
\v 8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
\p
\v 9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also \add my \add* hands and \add my\add* head.
\p
\v 10 Jesus saith to him, He that hath been bathed needeth not save to wash \add his\add* feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.
\p
\v 11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
\p
\v 12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?
\p
\v 13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.
\p
\v 14 If I then, \add your\add* Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.
\p
\v 15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.
\p
\v 16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
\p
\v 17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
\p
\v 18 ¶ I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.
\p
\v 19 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am \add he.\add*
\p
\v 20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
\p
\v 21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
\p
\v 22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
\p
\v 23 Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
\p
\v 24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.
\p
\v 25 He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
\p
\v 26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped \add it.\add* And when he had dipped the sop, he gave \add it \add* to Judas Iscariot, \add the son\add* of Simon.
\p
\v 27 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.
\p
\v 28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
\p
\v 29 For some \add of them\add* thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy \add those things\add* that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
\p
\v 30 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.
\p
\v 31 ¶ Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
\p
\v 32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
\p
\v 33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.
\p
\v 34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
\p
\v 35 By this shall all \add men\add* know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
\p
\v 36 ¶ Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.
\p
\v 37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.
\p
\v 38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.

\cl CHAPTER 14
\p
\v 1 ¶ Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
\p
\v 2 In my Father’s house are many mansions: if \add it were\add* not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
\p
\v 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, \add there\add* ye may be also.
\p
\v 4 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
\p
\v 5 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?
\p
\v 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
\p
\v 7 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. 
\p 
\v 8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
\p
\v 9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou \add then,\add* Show us the Father?
\p
\v 10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
\p
\v 11 Believe me that I \add am\add* in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.
\p
\v 12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater \add works\add* than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.
\p
\v 13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
\p
\v 14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do \add it\add*.
\p
\v 15 ¶ If ye love me, keep my commandments.
\p
\v 16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
\p
\v 17 \add Even\add* the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
\p
\v 18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
\p
\v 19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.
\p
\v 20 At that day ye shall know that I \add am\add* in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
\p
\v 21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
\p
\v 22 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
\p
\v 23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
\p
\v 24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
\p
\v 25 These things have I spoken unto you, being \add yet\add* present with you.
\p
\v 26 But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
\p
\v 27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
\p
\v 28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come \add again \add* unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
\p
\v 29 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.
\p
\v 30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.
\p
\v 31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
\c 15
\cl CHAPTER 15
\p
\v 1 ¶ I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
\p
\v 2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every \add branch\add* that beareth fruit, he cleanseth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
\p
\v 3 Even now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
\p
\v 4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
\p
\v 5 I am the vine, ye \add are\add* the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing.
\p
\v 6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast \add them\add* into the fire, and they are burned.
\p
\v 7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
\p
\v 8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.
\p
\v 9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.
\p
\v 10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.
\p
\v 11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and \add that\add* your joy might be full.
\p
\v 12 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.
\p
\v 13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
\p
\v 14 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
\p
\v 15 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
\p
\v 16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and \add that\add* your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
\p
\v 17 These things I command you, that ye love one another.
\p
\v 18 If the world hate you, ye know that \add it hated\add* me before it hated you.
\p
\v 19 If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
\p
\v 20 Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
\p
\v 21 But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.
\p
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.
\p
\v 23 He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
\p
\v 24 If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
\p
\v 25 But \add this cometh to pass,\add* that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
\p
\v 26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, \add even\add* the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:
\p
\v 27 And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
\c 16
\cl CHAPTER 16
\p
\v 1 ¶ These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.
\p
\v 2 They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.
\p
\v 3 And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
\p
\v 4 But these things have I told you, that when their hour shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.
\p
\v 5 But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
\p
\v 6 But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
\p
\v 7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.
\p
\v 8 And when he is come, he will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
\p
\v 9 Of sin, because they believe not on me;
\p
\v 10 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;
\p
\v 11 Of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged.
\p
\v 12 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
\p
\v 13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, \add that\add* shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.
\p
\v 14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show \add it\add* unto you.
\p
\v 15 All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show \add it\add* unto you.
\p
\v 16 A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.
\p
\v 17 Then said \add some\add* of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?
\p
\v 18 They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.
\p
\v 19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?
\p
\v 20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
\p
\v 21 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
\p
\v 22 And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.
\p
\v 23 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give \add it \add* you.
\p
\v 24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
\p
\v 25 These things have I spoken unto you in parables: but the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in parables, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.
\p
\v 26 At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:
\p
\v 27 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
\p
\v 28 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
\p
\v 29 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no parable.
\p
\v 30 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
\p
\v 31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
\p
\v 32 Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
\p
\v 33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
\c 17
\cl CHAPTER 17
\p
\v 1 ¶ These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:
\p
\v 2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
\p
\v 3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
\p
\v 4 I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
\p
\v 5 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
\p
\v 6 I have manifested thy name unto the men that thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.
\p
\v 7 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.
\p
\v 8 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received \add them,\add* and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.
\p
\v 9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them that thou hast given me; for they are thine.
\p
\v 10 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.
\p
\v 11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we \add are. \add*
\p
\v 12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
\p
\v 13 And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
\p
\v 14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
\p
\v 15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.
\p
\v 16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
\p
\v 17 Sanctify them in thy truth: thy word is truth.
\p
\v 18 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.
\p
\v 19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified in truth.
\p
\v 20 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also that shall believe on me through their word;
\p
\v 21 That they all may be one; as thou, Father, \add art\add* in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
\p
\v 22 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:
\p
\v 23 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.
\p
\v 24 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
\p
\v 25 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.
\p
\v 26 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare \add it: \add* that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.

\cl CHAPTER 18
\p
\v 1 ¶ When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered, and his disciples.
\p
\v 2 And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.
\p
\v 3 Judas then, having received a band \add of men\add* and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
\p
\v 4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?
\p
\v 5 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am \add he.\add* And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.
\p
\v 6 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am \add he,\add* they went backward, and fell to the ground.
\p
\v 7 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
\p
\v 8 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am \add he:\add* if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:
\p
\v 9 That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them whom thou gavest me have I lost none.
\p
\v 10 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
\p
\v 11 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
\p
\v 12 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
\p
\v 13 And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that same year.
\p
\v 14 Now Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and \add so did\add* another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
\p
\v 16 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
\p
\v 17 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also \add one\add* of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.
\p
\v 18 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
\p
\v 19 ¶ The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.
\p
\v 20 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.
\p
\v 21 Why askest thou me? ask them that heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.
\p
\v 22 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
\p
\v 23 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?
\p
\v 24 Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
\p
\v 25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also \add one\add* of his disciples? He denied \add it, \add* and said, I am not.
\p
\v 26 One of the servants of the high priest, being kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
\p
\v 27 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
\p
\v 28 ¶ Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
\p
\v 29 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?
\p
\v 30 They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.
\p
\v 31 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
\p
\v 32 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.
\p
\v 33 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered him, Askest thou this thing from thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?
\p
\v 35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
\p
\v 36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
\p
\v 37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
\p
\v 38 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault \add at all. \add*
\p
\v 39 But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
\p
\v 40 Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
\c 19
\cl CHAPTER 19
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged \add him. \add*
\p
\v 2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put \add it\add* on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
\p
\v 3 And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.
\p
\v 4 Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.
\p
\v 5 Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And \add Pilate\add* saith unto them, Behold the man!
\p
\v 6 When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify \add him,\add* crucify \add him.\add* Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify \add him:\add* for I find no fault in him.
\p
\v 7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
\p
\v 8 ¶ When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
\p
\v 9 And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
\p
\v 10 Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?
\p
\v 11 Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power \add at all\add* against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.
\p
\v 12 And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.
\p
\v 13 ¶ When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
\p
\v 14 And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!
\p
\v 15 But they cried out, Away with \add him,\add* away with \add him, \add* crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
\p
\v 16 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led \add him\add* away.
\p
\v 17 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called \add the place \add* of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:
\p
\v 18 Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And Pilate wrote a title, and put \add it\add* on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\p
\v 20 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, \add and \add* Greek, \add and\add* Latin.
\p
\v 21 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
\p
\v 22 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
\p
\v 23 ¶ Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also \add his\add* coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
\p
\v 24 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.
\p
\v 25 ¶ Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the \add wife\add* of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
\p
\v 26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
\p
\v 27 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own \add home\add*.
\p
\v 28 ¶ After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.
\p
\v 29 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put \add it\add* upon hyssop, and put \add it\add* to his mouth.
\p
\v 30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
\p
\v 31 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and \add that \add* they might be taken away.
\p
\v 32 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him.
\p
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
\p
\v 34 But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
\p
\v 35 And he that saw \add it\add* hath borne testimony, and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.
\p
\v 36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
\p
\v 37 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
\p
\v 38 ¶ And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave \add him\add* leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
\p
\v 39 And there came also Nicodemus, who at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound \add weight.\add*
\p
\v 40 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
\p
\v 41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.
\p
\v 42 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation \add day;\add* for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
\c 20
\cl CHAPTER 20
\p
\v 1 ¶ The first \add day\add* of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
\p
\v 2 Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
\p
\v 3 Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
\p
\v 4 So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
\p
\v 5 And he stooping down, \add and looking in,\add* saw the linen cloths lying; yet went he not in.
\p
\v 6 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen cloths lie,
\p
\v 7 And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
\p
\v 8 Then went in also that other disciple, who came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
\p
\v 9 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
\p
\v 10 Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
\p
\v 11 ¶ But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, \add and looked\add* into the sepulchre,
\p
\v 12 And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
\p
\v 13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
\p
\v 14 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
\p
\v 16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.
\p
\v 17 Jesus saith unto her, Hold me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and \add to\add* my God, and your God.
\p
\v 18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and \add that\add* he had spoken these things unto her.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Then the same day at evening, being the first \add day\add* of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace \add be\add* unto you.
\p
\v 20 And when he had so said, he showed unto them \add his\add* hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.
\p
\v 21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace \add be\add* unto you: as \add my\add* Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
\p
\v 22 And when he had said this, he breathed on \add them,\add* and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:
\p
\v 23 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; \add and \add* whose soever \add sins\add* ye retain, they are retained.
\p
\v 24 ¶ But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
\p
\v 25 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
\p
\v 26 ¶ And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: \add then\add* came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace \add be\add* unto you.
\p
\v 27 Then saith he to Thomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust \add it\add* into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
\p
\v 28 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
\p
\v 29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed \add are\add* they that have not seen, and \add yet\add* have believed.
\p
\v 30 ¶ And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
\p
\v 31 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.
\c 21
\cl CHAPTER 21
\p
\v 1 ¶ After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he \add himself. \add*
\p
\v 2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the \add sons\add* of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
\p
\v 3 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a boat immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
\p
\v 4 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
\p
\v 5 Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any thing to eat? They answered him, No.
\p
\v 6 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
\p
\v 7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt \add his \add* fisher’s coat \add unto him,\add* (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
\p
\v 8 And the other disciples came in a little boat; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
\p
\v 9 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
\p
\v 10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.
\p
\v 11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
\p
\v 12 Jesus saith unto them, Come! break your fast. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
\p
\v 13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
\p
\v 14 This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
\p
\v 15 ¶ So when they had eaten, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, \add son\add* of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
\p
\v 16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, \add son\add* of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
\p
\v 17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, \add son\add* of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
\p
\v 18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry \add thee\add* whither thou wouldest not.
\p
\v 19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
\p
\v 20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?
\p
\v 21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what \add shall\add* this man \add do? \add*
\p
\v 22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what \add is that\add* to thee? follow thou me.
\p
\v 23 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what \add is that\add* to thee?
\p
\v 24 This is the disciple who testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
\p
\v 25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.

\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ The former narrative I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
\p
\v 2 Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
\p
\v 3 To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:
\p
\v 4 And, being assembled together with \add them,\add* commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, \add saith he,\add* ye have heard from me.
\p
\v 5 For John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days hence.
\p
\v 6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
\p
\v 7 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own authority.
\p
\v 8 But ye shall receive power, after the Holy Spirit has come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
\p
\v 9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
\p
\v 10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
\p
\v 11 Who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
\p
\v 12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey.
\p
\v 13 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James \add the son\add* of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas \add the brother\add* of James.
\p
\v 14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)
\p
\v 16 Men \add and\add* brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.
\p
\v 17 For he was numbered with us, and had received a part in this ministry.
\p
\v 18 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
\p
\v 19 And it became known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their own tongue, Aceldama, that is, The field of blood.
\p
\v 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishopric let another take.
\p
\v 21 Therefore, of these men that have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
\p
\v 22 Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one of these become a witness with us of his resurrection.
\p
\v 23 And they set forth two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
\p
\v 24 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, show which of these two thou hast chosen,
\p
\v 25 That he may take the place in this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.
\p
\v 26 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all together in one place.
\p
\v 2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
\p
\v 3 And there appeared unto them tongues, as of fire, parting, and sitting upon each of them.
\p
\v 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
\p
\v 5 Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
\p
\v 6 And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.
\p
\v 7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilaeans?
\p
\v 8 And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born?
\p
\v 9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
\p
\v 10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers from Rome, Jews and proselytes,
\p
\v 11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our languages the wonderful works of God.
\p
\v 12 And they were all amazed and perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this?
\p
\v 13 Others, mocking, said, These men are full of new wine.
\p
\v 14 ¶ But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all \add ye\add* that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:
\p
\v 15 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is \add but\add* the third hour of the day.
\p
\v 16 But this is that which was spoken through the prophet Joel:
\p
\v 17 And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
\p
\v 18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy;
\p
\v 19 And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:
\p
\v 20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:
\p
\v 21 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
\p
\v 22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:
\p
\v 23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain;
\p
\v 24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
\p
\v 25 For David speaketh concerning him: I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
\p
\v 26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
\p
\v 27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
\p
\v 28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
\p
\v 29 Brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.
\p
\v 30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit on his throne;
\p
\v 31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.
\p
\v 32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
\p
\v 33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.
\p
\v 34 For David is not ascended into the heavens; but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
\p
\v 35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.
\p
\v 36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made this same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
\p
\v 37 ¶ Now when they heard \add this,\add* they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?
\p
\v 38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.
\p
\v 40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.
\p
\v 41 ¶ Then they, having received his word, were baptized: and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.
\p
\v 42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.
\p
\v 43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
\p
\v 44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
\p
\v 45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all \add men,\add* as every man had need.
\p
\v 46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their food with gladness and singleness of heart,
\p
\v 47 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to them daily those who were being saved.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, \add being\add* the ninth \add hour.\add* 
\p
\v 2 And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
\p
\v 3 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.
\p
\v 4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.
\p
\v 5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something from them.
\p
\v 6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.
\p
\v 7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted \add him\add* up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
\p
\v 8 And he leaping up stood, and began to walk, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
\p
\v 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
\p
\v 10 And they knew that it was he that sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
\p
\v 11 And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And when Peter saw \add it,\add* he answered unto the people: Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man to walk?
\p
\v 13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Servant Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let \add him\add* go.
\p
\v 14 But ye denied the Holy and Righteous One, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;
\p
\v 15 And killed the Prince of Life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.
\p
\v 16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is through him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
\p
\v 17 And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance ye did \add it,\add* as \add did\add* also your rulers.
\p
\v 18 But those things, which God had announced beforehand by the mouth of all his prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Repent ye therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, in order that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;
\p
\v 20 And that he may send the Christ, who before was preached unto you:
\p
\v 21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of the restitution of all things, of which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets from old time.
\p
\v 22 For Moses truly said: A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.
\p
\v 23 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* every soul that will not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.
\p
\v 24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold these days.
\p
\v 25 Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
\p
\v 26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Servant, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.

\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
\p
\v 2 Being sore troubled because they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
\p
\v 3 And they laid hands on them, and put \add them\add* in prison unto the next day: for it was now eventide.
\p
\v 4 But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of men became about five thousand.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,
\p
\v 6 And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 7 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, In what power, or in what name, have ye done this?
\p
\v 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them: Ye rulers of the people, and elders,
\p
\v 9 If we this day be examined as to the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;
\p
\v 10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, \add even\add* by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
\p
\v 11 This is the stone which was set at naught by you the builders, which became the head of the corner.
\p
\v 12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is no other name under heaven given among men, wherein we must be saved.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
\p
\v 14 And beholding the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
\p
\v 15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
\p
\v 16 Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable sign hath been done through them \add is\add* manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
\p
\v 18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach, in the name of Jesus.
\p
\v 19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them: Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye:
\p
\v 20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
\p
\v 21 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people: for all glorified God for what had been done.
\p
\v 22 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing had been wrought.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.
\p
\v 24 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said: Lord, thou \add art\add* God, who hast made the heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:
\p
\v 25 Who through the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of thy servant David our father, hast said, Why did the nations rage, and the peoples imagine vain things?
\p
\v 26 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Anointed.
\p
\v 27 For of a truth against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together in this city,
\p
\v 28 To do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel predestinated to come to pass.
\p
\v 29 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
\p
\v 30 By stretching forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Servant Jesus.
\p
\v 31 ¶ And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
\p
\v 32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and no one said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
\p
\v 33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; and great grace was upon them all.
\p
\v 34 For there was no one among them that was in want: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
\p
\v 35 And laid \add them\add* down at the apostles’ feet; and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.
\p
\v 36 And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, \add and\add* of the country of Cyprus,
\p
\v 37 Having land, sold \add it,\add* and brought the money, and laid \add it\add* at the apostles’ feet.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
\p
\v 2 And kept back \add part\add* of the price, his wife also being aware of \add it,\add* and brought a certain part, and laid \add it\add* at the apostles’ feet.
\p
\v 3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back \add part\add* of the price of the land?
\p
\v 4 While it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.
\p
\v 5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and expired: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.
\p
\v 6 And the younger men arose, wound him up, and carried \add him\add* out, and buried \add him.\add* 
\p
\v 7 And it was about three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.
\p
\v 8 And Peter said to her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.
\p
\v 9 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them that have buried thy husband \add are\add* at the door, and they shall carry thee out.
\p
\v 10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and expired: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying \add her\add* forth, buried \add her\add* by her husband.
\p
\v 11 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.
\p
\v 13 And of the rest no one dared join them: but the people magnified them.
\p
\v 14 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.
\p
\v 15 So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid \add them\add* on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.
\p
\v 16 There came also a multitude \add out\add* of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.
\p
\v 17 ¶ Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, which is the sect of the Sadducees, and were filled with jealousy,
\p
\v 18 And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.
\p
\v 19 But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,
\p
\v 20 Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life.
\p
\v 21 And when they heard \add that,\add* they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
\p
\v 22 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,
\p
\v 23 Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.
\p
\v 24 Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they were sore perplexed concerning them, whereunto this would grow.
\p
\v 25 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
\p
\v 26 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.
\p
\v 27 And when they had brought them, they set \add them\add* before the council. And the high priest asked them,
\p
\v 28 Saying, Did not we strictly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.
\p
\v 29 ¶ Then Peter and the \add other\add* apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men.
\p
\v 30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
\p
\v 31 Him hath God exalted by his right hand \add to be\add* a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
\p
\v 32 And we are his witnesses as to these things; and \add so is\add* also the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
\p
\v 33 ¶ When they heard \add that,\add* they were torn \add with rage,\add* and took counsel to slay them.
\p
\v 34 Then there stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honoured by all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little while,
\p
\v 35 And said unto them: Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.
\p
\v 36 For before these days rose up Theudas, claiming to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nothing.
\p
\v 37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away many people after him: he also perished; and all, \add even\add* as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.
\p
\v 38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing.
\p
\v 39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.
\p
\v 40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten \add them,\add* they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
\p
\v 41 ¶ And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour for the Name.
\p
\v 42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus as the Christ.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
\p
\v 2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples \add unto them,\add* and said: It is not befitting that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.
\p
\v 3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
\p
\v 4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:
\p
\v 6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid \add their\add* hands on them.
\p
\v 7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
\p
\v 8 And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then there arose certain of \add the synagogue,\add* which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.
\p
\v 10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake.
\p
\v 11 Then they suborned men, who said: We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and God.
\p
\v 12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon \add him,\add* and caught him, and brought \add him\add* to the council,
\p
\v 13 And set up false witnesses, who said: This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
\p
\v 14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.
\p
\v 15 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as the face of an angel.
\c 7
\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then said the high priest, Are these things so?
\p
\v 2 And he said: Brethren and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,
\p
\v 3 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.
\p
\v 4 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldasans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.
\p
\v 5 And he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not \add so much as\add* to set his foot on; yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when \add as yet\add* he had no child.
\p
\v 6 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and afflict them four hundred years.
\p
\v 7 And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
\p
\v 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so \add Abraham\add* begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac \add begat\add* Jacob; and Jacob \add begat\add* the twelve patriarchs.
\p
\v 9 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
\p
\v 10 And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
\p
\v 11 Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.
\p
\v 12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.
\p
\v 13 And at the second \add time\add* Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.
\p
\v 14 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to \add him,\add* and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
\p
\v 15 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
\p
\v 16 And were carried over unto Shechem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Hamor, in Shechem.
\p
\v 17 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
\p
\v 18 Till another king arose, who knew not Joseph.
\p
\v 19 The same dealt subtly with our kindred, and oppressed our fathers, that they should cast out their young children, to the end that they might not live.
\p
\v 20 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished in his father’s house three months;
\p
\v 21 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him as her own son.
\p
\v 22 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
\p
\v 23 And when he was about forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
\p
\v 24 And seeing one \add of them\add* suffer wrong, he defended \add him,\add* and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:
\p
\v 25 For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.
\p
\v 26 And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and urged them to peace, saying. Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
\p
\v 27 But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
\p
\v 28 Wilt thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?
\p
\v 29 And Moses fled at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.
\p
\v 30 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.
\p
\v 31 When Moses saw \add it,\add* he wondered at the sight; and as he drew near to behold \add it,\add* the voice of the Lord came unto him,
\p
\v 32 \add Saying,\add* I \add am\add* the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and dared not look.
\p
\v 33 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.
\p
\v 34 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
\p
\v 35 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send \add to be\add* a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.
\p
\v 36 He brought them out, after that he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
\p
\v 37 ¶ This is that Moses, who said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me.
\p
\v 38 This is he that was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel that spake to him in the mount Sinai, and \add with\add* our fathers: who received the living oracles to give unto us:
\p
\v 39 Whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,
\p
\v 40 Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for \add as for\add* this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
\p
\v 41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
\p
\v 42 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices \add by the space of\add* forty years in the wilderness?
\p
\v 43 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of the god Rephan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
\p
\v 44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.
\p
\v 45 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Joshua into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;
\p
\v 46 Who obtained favour before God, and desired to obtain a dwelling-place for the God of Jacob.
\p
\v 47 But Solomon built him a house.
\p
\v 48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,
\p
\v 49 Heaven \add is\add* my throne, and earth \add is\add* my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what \add is\add* the place of my rest?
\p
\v 50 Hath not my hand made all these things?
\p
\v 51 ¶ Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers \add did,\add* so \add do\add* ye.
\p
\v 52 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them that announced beforehand concerning the coming of the Righteous One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:
\p
\v 53 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept \add it\add*.
\p
\v 54 ¶ When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed their teeth against him.
\p
\v 55 But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
\p
\v 56 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
\p
\v 57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,
\p
\v 58 And cast \add him\add* out of the city, and stoned \add him:\add* and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.
\p
\v 59 And they stoned Stephen, as he was praying, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
\p
\v 60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice. Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
\c 8
\cl CHAPTER 8
\p
\v 1 ¶ And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
\p
\v 2 And devout men carried Stephen \add to his burial,\add* and made great lamentation over him.
\p
\v 3 As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into house after house, and dragging away men and women, committed \add them\add* to prison.
\p
\v 4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
\p
\v 5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.
\p
\v 6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
\p
\v 7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed \add with them:\add* and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
\p
\v 8 And there was great joy in that city.
\p
\v 9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, who beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and astonished the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
\p
\v 10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
\p
\v 11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had astonished them with sorceries.
\p
\v 12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
\p
\v 13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
\p
\v 14 Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
\p
\v 15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;
\p
\v 16 For he had not yet fallen upon any of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 17 Then laid they \add their\add* hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 18 And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,
\p
\v 19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
\p
\v 21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
\p
\v 22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.
\p
\v 23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and \add in\add* the bond of iniquity.
\p
\v 24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
\p
\v 25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
\p
\v 26 But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
\p
\v 27 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,
\p
\v 28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Isaiah the prophet.
\p
\v 29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
\p
\v 30 And Philip ran thither to \add him,\add* and heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
\p
\v 31 And he said, How can I, except some one should guide me? And he besought Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
\p
\v 32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
\p
\v 33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
\p
\v 34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
\p
\v 35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.
\p
\v 36 And as they went on \add their\add* way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, \add here is\add* water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
\p
\v 38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
\p
\v 39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing.
\p
\v 40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
\c 9
\cl CHAPTER 9
\p
\v 1 ¶ And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,
\p
\v 2 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any that were of the Way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him a light from heaven:
\p
\v 4 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
\p
\v 5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
\p
\v 6 But arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
\p
\v 7 And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no man.
\p
\v 8 And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought \add him\add* into Damascus.
\p
\v 9 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I \add am here,\add* Lord.
\p
\v 11 And the Lord \add said\add* unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for \add one\add* called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,
\p
\v 12 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting \add his\add* hand on him, that he might receive his sight.
\p
\v 13 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:
\p
\v 14 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.
\p
\v 15 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:
\p
\v 16 For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.
\p
\v 17 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, \add even\add* Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 18 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.
\p
\v 19 And when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus.
\p
\v 20 And straightway, in the synagogues, he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.
\p
\v 21 But all that heard \add him\add* were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them that called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for this purpose, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?
\p
\v 22 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the very Christ.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:
\p
\v 24 But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
\p
\v 25 But the disciples took him by night, and let \add him\add* down through the wall in a basket.
\p
\v 26 And coming to Jerusalem, he essayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.
\p
\v 27 But Barnabas took him, and brought \add him\add* to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
\p
\v 28 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 29 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord, and disputed against the Grecian Jews; but they sought to slay him.
\p
\v 30 \add Which\add* when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
\p
\v 31 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied.
\p
\v 32 ¶ And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all \add quarters,\add* he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.
\p
\v 33 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years, and was paralyzed.
\p
\v 34 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus, the Christ, maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.
\p
\v 35 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the Lord.
\p
\v 36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
\p
\v 37 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid in an upper chamber.
\p
\v 38 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the; disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring \add him\add* that he would not delay to come to them.
\p
\v 39 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
\p
\v 40 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
\p
\v 41 And he gave her \add his\add* hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.
\p
\v 42 And it came to be known throughout all Joppa; and many believed on the Lord.
\p
\v 43 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
\c 10
\cl CHAPTER 10
\p
\v 1 ¶ There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian \add band,\add* 
\p
\v 2 A devout \add man,\add* and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.
\p
\v 3 He saw in a vision clearly, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.
\p
\v 4 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up for a memorial before God.
\p
\v 5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for \add one\add* Simon, whose surname is Peter:
\p
\v 6 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side.
\p
\v 7 And when the angel that spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;
\p
\v 8 And when he had declared all \add these\add* things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.
\p
\v 9 ¶ On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:
\p
\v 10 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,
\p
\v 11 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, like a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
\p
\v 12 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
\p
\v 13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
\p
\v 14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.
\p
\v 15 And the voice \add spake\add* unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, \add that\add* call not thou common.
\p
\v 16 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
\p
\v 17 Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what this vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,
\p
\v 18 And called, and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, lodged there.
\p
\v 19 ¶ While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.
\p
\v 20 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.
\p
\v 21 Then Peter went down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what \add is\add* the cause wherefore ye are come?
\p
\v 22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a righteous man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.
\p
\v 23 Then he called them in, and lodged \add them.\add* And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
\p
\v 24 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends
\p
\v 25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped \add him.\add* 
\p
\v 26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
\p
\v 27 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.
\p
\v 28 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
\p
\v 29 Therefore came I \add unto you\add* without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?
\p
\v 30 And Cornelius said, Four days ago, at the ninth hour, I was praying in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
\p
\v 31 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
\p
\v 32 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodging in the house of Simon a tanner by the sea side.
\p
\v 33 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of the Lord.
\p
\v 34 ¶ Then Peter opened \add his\add* mouth, and said: Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;
\p
\v 35 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him,
\p
\v 36 The word which \add God\add* sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ; (he is Lord of all;)
\p
\v 37 That word, \add I say,\add* ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
\p
\v 38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
\p
\v 39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:
\p
\v 40 Him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly;
\p
\v 41 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, \add even\add* to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.
\p
\v 42 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he who hath been ordained of God \add to be\add* the Judge of living and dead.
\p
\v 43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth on him shall receive remission of sins.
\p
\v 44 ¶ While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word.
\p
\v 45 And they of the circumcision that believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was ooured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,
\p
\v 47 Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?
\p
\v 48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they besought him to tarry certain days.
\c 11
\cl CHAPTER 11
\p
\v 1 ¶ And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
\p
\v 2 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
\p
\v 3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.
\p
\v 4 But Peter rehearsed \add the matter\add* from the beginning, and expounded \add it\add* in order unto them, saying:
\p
\v 5 I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:
\p
\v 6 Upon which, when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and birds of the air.
\p
\v 7 And also I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
\p
\v 8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.
\p
\v 9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, \add that\add* call not thou common.
\p
\v 10 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
\p
\v 11 And, behold, immediately three men were at the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.
\p
\v 12 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:
\p
\v 13 And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said. Send to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;
\p
\v 14 Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shalt be saved.
\p
\v 15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.
\p
\v 16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 17 Forasmuch then as God gave unto them the same gift as unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?
\p
\v 18 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Now they that were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.
\p
\v 20 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks, preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.
\p
\v 22 ¶ Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth; Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.
\p
\v 23 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.
\p
\v 24 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and many people were added unto the Lord.
\p
\v 25 Then he went to Tarsus, to seek for Saul;
\p
\v 26 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that for a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught a great multitude. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
\p
\v 28 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great famine over all the inhabited earth; which came to pass in the days of Claudius.
\p
\v 29 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in Judaea:
\p
\v 30 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
\c 12
\cl CHAPTER 12
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth \add his\add* hands to hurt some of those of the church.
\p
\v 2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
\p
\v 3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
\p
\v 4 And when he had seized him, he put \add him\add* in prison, and delivered \add him\add* to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.
\p
\v 5 Peter therefore was kept in prison; but instant and earnest prayer was made by the church unto God for him.
\p
\v 6 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
\p
\v 7 And, behold, an angel of the Lord stood over \add him,\add* and a light shone in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and awakened him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off \add his\add* hands.
\p
\v 8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
\p
\v 9 And he went out, and followed him; and knew not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
\p
\v 10 When they were past the first and the second watch, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.
\p
\v 11 And when Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and \add from\add* all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
\p
\v 12 And when he had considered \add the thing,\add* he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying
\p
\v 13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maidservant came to answer, named Rhoda.
\p
\v 14 And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.
\p
\v 15 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.
\p
\v 16 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened \add the door,\add* and saw him, they were astonished.
\p
\v 17 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go tell these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.
\p
\v 18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what had become of Peter.
\p
\v 19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that \add they\add* should be led away to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and \add there\add* abode.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus, who was over the king’s bed-chamber, their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s \add country.\add* 
\p
\v 21 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.
\p
\v 22 And the people shouted. The voice of a god, and not of a man!
\p
\v 23 And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten by worms, and expired.
\p
\v 24 ¶ But the word of God grew and multiplied.
\p
\v 25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had completed \add their\add* mission, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.
\c 13
\cl CHAPTER 13
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now there were in the church that was at Antioch, prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
\p
\v 2 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
\p
\v 3 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid \add their\add* hands on them, they sent \add them\add* away.
\p
\v 4 ¶ So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
\p
\v 5 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as \add their\add* attendant.
\p
\v 6 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name \add was\add* Bar-jesus:
\p
\v 7 Who was with the proconsul of the country, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.
\p
\v 8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
\p
\v 9 Then Saul, (who also \add is called\add* Paul,) filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes on him,
\p
\v 10 And said, O full of all deceit and all villainy, \add thou\add* son of the devil, \add thou\add* enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
\p
\v 11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord \add is\add* upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
\p
\v 12 Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
\p
\v 13 Now Paul and his company, having sailed from Paphos, came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 14 ¶ But having departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.
\p
\v 15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
\p
\v 16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with \add his\add* hand said: Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.
\p
\v 17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.
\p
\v 18 And about the time of forty years he bore with their ways in the wilderness.
\p
\v 19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan,he gave them their land as an inheritance.
\p
\v 20 And after that he gave \add unto them\add* judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
\p
\v 21 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.
\p
\v 22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the \add son\add* of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who will fulfil all my will.
\p
\v 23 Of this man’s seed hath God according to \add his\add* promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus,
\p
\v 24 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
\p
\v 25 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not \add he.\add* But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of \add his\add* feet I am not worthy to loose.
\p
\v 26 Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
\p
\v 27 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled \add them\add* in condemning \add him.\add* 
\p
\v 28 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.
\p
\v 29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took \add him\add* down from the tree, and laid \add him\add* in a sepulchre.
\p
\v 30 But God raised him from the dead.
\p
\v 31 And he was seen many days by them who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.
\p
\v 32 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,
\p
\v 33 God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
\p
\v 34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, \add now\add* no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.
\p
\v 35 Wherefore he saith also in another \add psalm,\add* Thou shalt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
\p
\v 36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, and was laid beside his fathers, and saw corruption:
\p
\v 37 But he whom God raised again saw no corruption.
\p
\v 38 ¶ Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:
\p
\v 39 And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
\p
\v 40 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;
\p
\v 41 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.
\p
\v 42 And as they went out, they besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.
\p
\v 43 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
\p
\v 44 ¶ And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.
\p
\v 45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.
\p
\v 46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
\p
\v 47 For so hath the Lord commanded us, \add saying,\add* I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldst be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.
\p
\v 48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
\p
\v 49 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.
\p
\v 50 But the Jews stirred up the devout women of rank, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their borders.
\p
\v 51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.
\p
\v 52 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
\c 14
\cl CHAPTER 14
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
\p
\v 2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds embittered against the brethren.
\p
\v 3 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, who gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
\p
\v 4 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
\p
\v 5 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use \add them\add* despitefully, and to stone them,
\p
\v 6 They were aware of \add it,\add* and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:
\p
\v 7 And there they preached the gospel.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked:
\p
\v 9 The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
\p
\v 10 Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.
\p
\v 11 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
\p
\v 12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.
\p
\v 13 Then the priest of Jupiter, who was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.
\p
\v 14 \add Which\add* when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard \add of,\add* they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
\p
\v 15 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein;
\p
\v 16 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
\p
\v 17 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
\p
\v 18 And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, from offering sacrifice unto them.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And there came thither \add certain\add* Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, dragged \add him\add* out of the city, supposing he was dead.
\p
\v 20 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
\p
\v 21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch,
\p
\v 22 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through many tribulations enter into the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 23 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
\p
\v 24 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
\p
\v 25 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:
\p
\v 26 And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
\p
\v 27 And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.
\p
\v 28 And there they abode a long time with the disciples.
\c 15
\cl CHAPTER 15
\p
\v 1 ¶ And certain men who came down from Judaea taught the brethren, \add and said,\add* Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
\p
\v 2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.
\p
\v 3 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.
\p
\v 4 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.
\p
\v 5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees that believed, saying that it was needful to circumcise them, and to command \add them\add* to keep the law of Moses.
\p
\v 6 ¶ And the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter.
\p
\v 7 And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them. Brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
\p
\v 8 And God, who knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as unto us;
\p
\v 9 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
\p
\v 10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
\p
\v 11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved, even as they.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me.
\p
\v 14 Simon hath declared how God for the first time visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
\p
\v 15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
\p
\v 16 After this I will return, and will build again the house of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:
\p
\v 17 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.
\p
\v 18 Known unto God are all his works from eternity.
\p
\v 19 Wherefore my judgment is that we trouble not those who from among the Gentiles are turned to God:
\p
\v 20 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and \add from\add* fornication, and \add from\add* things strangled, and \add from\add* blood.
\p
\v 21 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
\p
\v 22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; \add namely,\add* Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:
\p
\v 23 And they wrote by them after this manner: The apostles and elders and brethren \add send\add* greeting unto the brethren who are from the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:
\p
\v 24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, \add Ye must\add* be circumcised, and keep the law— to whom we gave no \add such\add* commandment;
\p
\v 25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
\p
\v 26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell \add you\add* the same things by mouth.
\p
\v 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
\p
\v 29 That ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.
\p
\v 30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch, and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle,
\p
\v 31 \add Which\add* when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.
\p
\v 32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 33 And after they had tarried \add there\add* a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto those who had sent them.
\p
\v 34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
\p
\v 35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, \add and see\add* how they do.
\p
\v 37 And Barnabas proposed to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.
\p
\v 38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
\p
\v 39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other; and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;
\p
\v 40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being committed by the brethren unto the grace of God.
\p
\v 41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
\c 16
\cl CHAPTER 16
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman, a believer; but his father \add was\add* a Greek;
\p
\v 2 Who was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
\p
\v 3 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those quarters: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
\p
\v 4 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for observance, which had been ordained by the apostles and elders that were at . Jerusalem.
\p
\v 5 And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
\p
\v 6 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia,
\p
\v 7 After they were come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not.
\p
\v 8 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
\p
\v 9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There stood a man of Macedonia, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
\p
\v 10 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel unto them.
\p
\v 11 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;
\p
\v 12 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, \add and\add* a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.
\p
\v 13 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that resorted \add thither\add*.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard \add us:\add* whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken by Paul.
\p
\v 15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought \add us,\add* saying, If ye have judged me to be a believer in the Lord, come into my house, and abide. And she constrained us.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain maidservant possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.
\p
\v 17 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who show unto us the way of salvation.
\p
\v 18 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and dragged \add them\add* into the marketplace unto the rulers,
\p
\v 20 And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
\p
\v 21 And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.
\p
\v 22 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast \add them\add* into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely;
\p
\v 24 Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
\p
\v 25 ¶ And at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God; and the prisoners were listening to them.
\p
\v 26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bonds were loosed.
\p
\v 27 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.
\p
\v 28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
\p
\v 29 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,
\p
\v 30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
\p
\v 31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.
\p
\v 32 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.
\p
\v 33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed \add their\add* stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.
\p
\v 34 And when he had brought them into his house, he laid the table for them, and rejoiced, having believed God, with all his house.
\p
\v 35 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.
\p
\v 36 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore depart, and go in peace.
\p
\v 37 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast \add us\add* into prison; and now do they thrust us out secretly? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.
\p
\v 38 And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates; and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans;
\p
\v 39 And they came and besought them, and brought \add them\add* out, and desired \add them\add* to depart out of the city
\p
\v 40 And they went out of the prison, and entered into \add the house of\add* Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
\c 17
\cl CHAPTER 17
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
\p
\v 2 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
\p
\v 3 Opening and alleging, that the Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is the Christ.
\p
\v 4 And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
\p
\v 5 ¶ But the Jews, moved with envy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and gathered a company, and set all the city in an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.
\p
\v 6 And when they found them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;
\p
\v 7 Whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, \add one\add* Jesus.
\p
\v 8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
\p
\v 9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming \add thither\add* went into the synagogue of the Jews.
\p
\v 11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.
\p
\v 12 Therefore many of them believed; also of Greek women of rank, and of men, not a few.
\p
\v 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.
\p
\v 14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timothy abode there still.
\p
\v 15 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.
\p
\v 16 ¶ Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him as he beheld the city full of idols.
\p
\v 17 Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.
\p
\v 18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? But others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods; because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.
\p
\v 19 And they took him, and brought him unto Mars’ hill, saying, May we know what this new teaching, whereof thou speakest, \add is?\add*
\p
\v 20 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
\p
\v 21 Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there found time for nothing else but either to tell or to hear the last new thing.
\p
\v 22 ¶ Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, \add Ye\add* men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are very religious.
\p
\v 23 For as I passed by, and beheld the objects of your worship, I found an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.
\p
\v 24 The God who made the earth and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
\p
\v 25 Neither is he served by men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
\p
\v 26 And hath made of one all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
\p
\v 27 That they should seek God, if perhaps they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us;
\p
\v 28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
\p
\v 29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.
\p
\v 30 And the times of this ignorance God overlooked; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:
\p
\v 31 Because he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by \add that\add* man whom he hath ordained; \add whereof\add* he hath given assurance unto all \add men,\add* in that he hath raised him from the dead.
\p
\v 32 ¶ And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this \add matter.\add* 
\p
\v 33 So Paul departed from among them.
\p
\v 34 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed, among whom \add were\add* Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
\c 18
\cl CHAPTER 18
\p
\v 1 ¶ After these things he departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
\p
\v 2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome), and came unto them.
\p
\v 3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
\p
\v 4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
\p
\v 5 And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, and testified to the Jews \add that\add* Jesus \add was\add* the Christ.
\p
\v 6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook \add his\add* raiment, and said unto them, Your blood \add be\add* upon your own heads; I \add am\add* clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And he departed thence, and entered into a certain \add man’s\add* house, named Titus Justus, \add one\add* that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
\p
\v 8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed and were baptized.
\p
\v 9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace;
\p
\v 10 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have many people in this city.
\p
\v 11 And he continued \add there\add* a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And when Gallio was the proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
\p
\v 13 Saying, This \add fellow\add* persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
\p
\v 14 And when Paul was now about to open \add his\add* mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked villainy, O \add ye\add* Jews, reason would that I should bear with you;
\p
\v 15 But if it be a question of words and names, and \add of\add* your law, look ye \add to it;\add* for I will be no judge of such \add matters.\add* 
\p
\v 16 And he drove them from the judgment seat.
\p
\v 17 And they all took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat \add him\add* before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.
\p
\v 18 ¶ And Paul \add after this\add* tarried \add there\add* yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn \add his\add* head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.
\p
\v 19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there, but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
\p
\v 20 When they desired \add him\add* to tarry longer time with them, he consented not,
\p
\v 21 But bade them farewell, saying, I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.
\p
\v 22 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
\p
\v 23 And after he had spent some time \add there,\add* he departed, and went over \add all\add* the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, \add and\add* mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
\p
\v 25 This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.
\p
\v 26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto \add them,\add* and expounded unto him the way of God more thoroughly .
\p
\v 27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much that had believed through grace,
\p
\v 28 For he powerfully confuted the Jews, publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
\c 19
\cl CHAPTER 19
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper region, came to Ephesus; and finding certain disciples,
\p
\v 2 He said unto them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 3 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism.
\p
\v 4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should come after him, that is, on Jesus.
\p
\v 5 When they heard \add this,\add* they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 6 And when Paul had laid \add his\add* hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
\p
\v 7 And all the men were about twelve.
\p
\v 8 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading as to the things concerning the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 9 But when some were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
\p
\v 10 And this continued by the space of two years, so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
\p
\v 11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul,
\p
\v 12 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then certain of the wandering Jewish exorcists took upon them to call over them that had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.
\p
\v 14 And there were seven sons of \add one\add* Sceva, a Jew, \add and\add* chief of the priests, who did so.
\p
\v 15 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?
\p
\v 16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
\p
\v 17 And this came to be known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
\p
\v 18 And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.
\p
\v 19 Many of them also that practiced magical arts brought their books together, and burned them before all; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand \add pieces\add* of silver.
\p
\v 20 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
\p
\v 21 ¶ After these things were ended, Paul purposed in spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
\p
\v 22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.
\p
\v 23 And the same time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.
\p
\v 24 For a certain \add man\add* named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;
\p
\v 25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.
\p
\v 26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, which are made with hands;
\p
\v 27 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at naught; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the inhabited earth worshippeth.
\p
\v 28 And when they heard \add these sayings,\add* they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great \add is\add* 3 Diana of the Ephesians.
\p
\v 29 And the whole city was filled with confusion, and having caught Gains and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.
\p
\v 30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.
\p
\v 31 And certain of the Asiarchs, who were his friends, sent unto him, urging that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.
\p
\v 32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.
\p
\v 33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defence unto the people.
\p
\v 34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is aDiana of the Ephesians !
\p
\v 35 And when the townclerk had quieted the people, he said, \add Ye\add* men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great goddess Diana, and of the \add image\add* which fell down from Jupiter?
\p
\v 36 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.
\p
\v 37 For ye have brought hither these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.
\p
\v 38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen who are with him, have a matter against any man, courts are held, and there are proconsuls; let them prosecute one another.
\p
\v 39 But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
\p
\v 40 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.
\p
\v 41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
\c 20
\cl CHAPTER 20
\p
\v 1 ¶ And after the uproar had ceased, Paul called unto \add him\add* the disciples, and embraced \add them,\add* and departed to go into Macedonia.
\p
\v 2 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,
\p
\v 3 And \add there\add* abode three months. And when a plot was formed against him by the Jews, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.
\p
\v 4 And there accompanied him into Asia, Sopater son of Pyrrhus, of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia Tychicus and Trophimus.
\p
\v 5 These going before tarried for us at Troas.
\p
\v 6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.
\p
\v 7 And upon the first \add day\add* of the week, when we came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.
\p
\v 8 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where we were gathered together.
\p
\v 9 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep; and as Paul was long preaching, he sank down with sleep, and fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.
\p
\v 10 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing \add him\add* said, Make ye no ado, for his life is in him.
\p
\v 11 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.
\p
\v 12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And we went before to the ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul; for so had he appointed, intending himself to go afoot.
\p
\v 14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.
\p
\v 15 And we sailed thence, and came the next \add day\add* over against Chios; and the next \add day\add* we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next \add day\add* we came to Miletus.
\p
\v 16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not have to spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
\p
\v 18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,
\p
\v 19 Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me through the plots of the Jews;
\p
\v 20 \add And\add* how I shrank not from declaring anything that was profitable \add unto you,\add* but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,
\p
\v 21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there,
\p
\v 23 Save that the Holy Spirit witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.
\p
\v 24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
\p
\v 25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom, shall see my face no more.
\p
\v 26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I \add am\add* pure from the blood of all \add men.\add* 
\p
\v 27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
\p
\v 28 ¶ Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Spirit hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
\p
\v 29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
\p
\v 30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
\p
\v 31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
\p
\v 32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are sanctified.
\p
\v 33 I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
\p
\v 34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
\p
\v 35 In all things I have given you an example, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.
\p
\v 37 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,
\p
\v 38 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.
\c 21
\cl CHAPTER 21
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and the \add day\add* following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:
\p
\v 2 And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.
\p
\v 3 Now when we had come in sight of Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.
\p
\v 4 And finding the disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 5 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till \add we were\add* out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
\p
\v 6 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.
\p
\v 7 And when we had finished \add our\add* course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.
\p
\v 8 And the next \add day\add* we departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was \add one\add* of the seven; and abode with him.
\p
\v 9 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, who did prophesy.
\p
\v 10 And as we tarried \add there\add* many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
\p
\v 11 And coming to us and taking Paul’s girdle, he bound his own hands and feet, and said. Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
\p
\v 12 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 13 Then Paul answered, What mean ye, to weep and to break my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And after those days we took up our baggage, and went up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 16 There went with us also \add certain\add* of the disciples from Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.
\p
\v 17 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
\p
\v 18 And the \add day\add* following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
\p
\v 19 And when he had saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
\p
\v 20 And when they heard \add it,\add* they glorified God, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are that believe; and they are all zealous of the law:
\p
\v 21 And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews that are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise \add their\add* children, neither to walk after the customs.
\p
\v 22 What is it therefore? for they will certainly hear that thou art come.
\p
\v 23 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men who have a vow on them;
\p
\v 24 Then take, and purify thyself with them, and bear their expenses, that they may shave \add their\add* heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but \add that\add* thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.
\p
\v 25 As touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written, deciding that they should observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from \add things\add* offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.
\p
\v 26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews that were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,
\p
\v 28 Crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man, that teacheth all \add men\add* every where against the people, and the law, and this place; and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.
\p
\v 29 For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.
\p
\v 30 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together, and they took Paul, and dragged him out of the temple, and forthwith the doors were shut.
\p
\v 31 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar;
\p
\v 32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them; and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left off beating Paul.
\p
\v 33 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded \add him\add* to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
\p
\v 34 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude; and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
\p
\v 35 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.
\p
\v 36 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.
\p
\v 37 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
\p
\v 38 Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
\p
\v 39 But Paul said, I am a man \add who am\add* a Jew of Tarsus, \add a city\add* in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.
\p
\v 40 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto \add them\add* in the Hebrew tongue, saying:
\c 22
\cl CHAPTER 22
\p
\v 1 ¶ Brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence \add which I make\add* now unto you.
\p
\v 2 And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence; and he saith,
\p
\v 3 I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and instructed according to the strict manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
\p
\v 4 And I persecuted this Way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
\p
\v 5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders; from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them that were there bound unto Jerusalem, to be punished.
\p
\v 6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
\p
\v 7 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
\p
\v 8 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
\p
\v 9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
\p
\v 10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
\p
\v 11 And as I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
\p
\v 12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews that dwelt \add there,\add* 
\p
\v 13 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
\p
\v 14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldst know his will, and see the Righteous One, and shouldst hear the voice of his mouth.
\p
\v 15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
\p
\v 16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name.
\p
\v 17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance,
\p
\v 18 And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
\p
\v 19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee;
\p
\v 20 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
\p
\v 21 And he said unto me, Depart; for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.
\p
\v 22 And they gave him audience unto this word, and \add then\add* lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a \add fellow\add* from the earth! for it is not fit that he should live.
\p
\v 23 And as they cried out, and cast off \add their\add* clothes, and threw dust into the air,
\p
\v 24 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him.
\p
\v 25 And when they had tied him up with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
\p
\v 26 When the centurion heard \add that,\add* he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest, for this man is a Roman.
\p
\v 27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
\p
\v 28 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am a Roman born.
\p
\v 29 Then straightway they departed from him who were about to examine him; and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
\p
\v 30 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
\c 23
\cl CHAPTER 23
\p
\v 1 ¶ And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God unto this day.
\p
\v 2 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
\p
\v 3 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, \add thou\add* whited wall; for sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
\p
\v 4 And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?
\p
\v 5 Then said Paul, I knew not, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
\p
\v 6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees! Of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
\p
\v 7 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the assembly was divided.
\p
\v 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
\p
\v 9 And there arose a great clamour; and the scribes \add that were\add* of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man; and what if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him?
\p
\v 10 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring \add him\add* into the castle.
\p
\v 11 And the night following, the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear testimony also at Rome.
\p
\v 12 And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
\p
\v 13 And they were more than forty that had made this conspiracy.
\p
\v 14 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will taste nothing until we have slain Paul.
\p
\v 15 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him; and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
\p
\v 16 But when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
\p
\v 17 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto \add him,\add* and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.
\p
\v 18 So he took him, and brought \add him\add* to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto \add him,\add* and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.
\p
\v 19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went \add with him\add* aside privately, and asked \add him,\add* What is that thou hast to tell me?
\p
\v 20 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.
\p
\v 21 But do not thou yield unto them; for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him; and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.
\p
\v 22 So the chief captain \add then\add* let the young man depart, and charged \add him, See thou\add* tell no man that thou hast showed these things to me.
\p
\v 23 And he called unto \add him\add* two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
\p
\v 24 And provide \add them\add* beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring \add him\add* safe unto Felix the governor.
\p
\v 25 And he wrote a letter after this manner:
\p
\v 26 Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix \add sendeth\add* greeting.
\p
\v 27 This man was seized by the Jews, and should have been killed of them; then I came upon them with the soldiers, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
\p
\v 28 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council;
\p
\v 29 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
\p
\v 30 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what \add they had\add* against him. Farewell.
\p
\v 31 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought \add him\add* by night to Antipatris.
\p
\v 32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle;
\p
\v 33 Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
\p
\v 34 And having read it, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that \add he was\add* of Cilicia;
\p
\v 35 I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s palace.
\c 24
\cl CHAPTER 24
\p
\v 1 ¶ And after five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders, and \add with\add* a certain orator \add named\add* Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
\p
\v 2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse \add him,\add* saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy care,
\p
\v 3 We accept \add it\add* always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
\p
\v 4 But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.
\p
\v 5 For we have found this man \add a\add* pest, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes;
\p
\v 6 Who also hath gone about to profane the temple; whom we seized, and would have judged according to our law.
\p
\v 7 But the chief captain Lysias came \add upon us,\add* and with great violence took \add him\add* away out of our hands,
\p
\v 8 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee; by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.
\p
\v 9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
\p
\v 10 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself;
\p
\v 11 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
\p
\v 12 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city
\p
\v 13 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
\p
\v 14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets,
\p
\v 15 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also accept, that there shall be a resurrection, both of the just and unjust.
\p
\v 16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and \add toward\add* men.
\p
\v 17 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
\p
\v 18 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult;
\p
\v 19 Who ought to have been here before thee, and accuse, if they had aught against me.
\p
\v 20 Or else let these themselves say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
\p
\v 21 Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day!
\p
\v 22 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge concerning the Way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.
\p
\v 23 And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul, and to let \add him\add* have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix, becoming afraid, answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
\p
\v 26 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul; wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and conversed with him.
\p
\v 27 But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favour with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.
\c 25
\cl CHAPTER 25
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,
\p
\v 3 Asking as a favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying a plot to kill him on the way.
\p
\v 4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly \add thither.\add* 
\p
\v 5 Let them therefore, said he, that among you are able, go down with \add me,\add* and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.
\p
\v 6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.
\p
\v 7 And when he was come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.
\p
\v 8 But Paul said in defence: Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I committed any offence.
\p
\v 9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
\p
\v 10 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou also very well knowest.
\p
\v 11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.
\p
\v 12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.
\p
\v 14 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix,
\p
\v 15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed \add me,\add* desiring \add to have\add* judgment against him.
\p
\v 16 To whom I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he who is accused has the accusers face to face, and has opportunity to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.
\p
\v 17 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
\p
\v 18 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed,
\p
\v 19 But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
\p
\v 20 And being perplexed as to the manner of investigating these things, I asked \add him\add* whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.
\p
\v 21 But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.
\p
\v 22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.
\p
\v 24 And Festus said: King Agrippa, and all who are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have petitioned me, both at Jerusalem, and \add also\add* here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
\p
\v 25 But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself had appealed to the emperor, I determined to send him;
\p
\v 26 Of whom I have nothing certain to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, when the examination has taken place, I might have somewhat to write.
\p
\v 27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes \add laid\add* against him.
\c 26
\cl CHAPTER 26
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
\p
\v 2 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews;
\p
\v 3 Especially \add because I know\add* thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
\p
\v 4 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
\p
\v 5 Who knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
\p
\v 6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
\p
\v 7 Unto which \add promise\add* our twelve tribes, earnestly serving \add God\add* day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
\p
\v 8 Why should it be judged a thing incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?
\p
\v 9 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
\p
\v 10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem; and many of the saints did I shut up in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my vote against \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, to compel \add them\add* to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted \add them\add* even unto strange cities.
\p
\v 12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,
\p
\v 13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and those journeying with me.
\p
\v 14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? \add it is\add* hard for thee to kick against the goads.
\p
\v 15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.
\p 
\v 16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things in which thou hast seen me, and of those things in which I will appear unto thee;
\p
\v 17 Delivering thee from the people, and \add from\add* the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,
\p
\v 18 To open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.
\p
\v 19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
\p
\v 20 But announced first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and \add then\add* to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works consistent with repentance.
\p
\v 21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill \add me.\add* 
\p
\v 22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
\p
\v 23 That the Christ must suffer, \add and\add* that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should proclaim light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
\p
\v 25 But Paul said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.
\p
\v 26 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
\p
\v 27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
\p
\v 28 Then Agrippa \add said\add* unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldst fain make me a Christian.
\p
\v 29 And Paul said, I would to God, that, whether with little or with much, not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, should become such as I am, except these bonds.
\p
\v 30 And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them,
\p
\v 31 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
\p
\v 32 And Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
\c 27
\cl CHAPTER 27
\p
\v 1 ¶ And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto \add one\add* named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan band.
\p
\v 2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; \add one\add* Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
\p
\v 3 And the next \add day\add* we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously treated Paul, and gave \add him\add* liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.
\p
\v 4 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
\p
\v 5 And when we had sailed over the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, \add a city\add* of Lycia.
\p
\v 6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us thereon.
\p
\v 7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not further suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
\p
\v 8 And, coasting along it with difficulty, we came unto a place which is called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city \add of\add* Lasea.
\p
\v 9 ¶ Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already past, Paul admonished \add them,\add* 
\p
\v 10 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with disaster and much loss, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
\p
\v 11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.
\p
\v 12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phoenix, \add and there\add* to winter; \add which is\add* a haven of Crete, and lieth toward the southwest and northwest.
\p
\v 13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained \add their\add* purpose, loosing \add thence,\add* they sailed close by Crete.
\p
\v 14 But not long after there beat against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.
\p
\v 15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let \add her\add* drive.
\p
\v 16 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to secure the boat;
\p
\v 17 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon Syrtis, they lowered the sail, and so were driven.
\p
\v 18 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next \add day\add* they lightened the ship;
\p
\v 19 And the third \add day\add* they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.
\p
\v 20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on \add us,\add* all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.
\p
\v 21 And when they had been long without food, Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
\p
\v 22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
\p
\v 23 For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, and whom I serve,
\p
\v 24 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
\p
\v 25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer, for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.
\p
\v 26 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
\p
\v 27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the sailors deemed that they drew near to some country;
\p
\v 28 And sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.
\p
\v 29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
\p
\v 30 And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
\p
\v 31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
\p
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
\p
\v 33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought \add them\add* all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
\p
\v 34 Wherefore I pray you to take some food; for this is for your safety; for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.
\p
\v 35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.
\p
\v 36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took food.
\p
\v 37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
\p
\v 38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.
\p
\v 39 And when it was day, they did not recognize the land: but they discovered a certain bay, having a beach, into which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
\p
\v 40 And when they had cut the anchors, they left them in the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the foresail to the wind, and made toward shore.
\p
\v 41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part began to break up with the violence of the waves.
\p
\v 42 And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
\p
\v 43 But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from \add their\add* purpose; and commanded that they that could swim should be the first to cast \add themselves into the sea,\add* and get to land,
\p
\v 44 And the rest, some on boards, and some on \add broken pieces\add* of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to land.
\c 28
\cl CHAPTER 28
\p
\v 1 ¶ And having escaped, we discovered that the island was called Melita.
\p
\v 2 And the inhabitants showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
\p
\v 3 But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid \add them\add* on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
\p
\v 4 And when the inhabitants saw the \add venomous\add* beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet Justice suffereth not to live.
\p
\v 5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
\p
\v 6 Howbeit they expected that he would swell, or fall down dead suddenly, but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Now in the same region were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
\p
\v 8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
\p
\v 9 So when this was done, others also who had diseases in the island, came, and were healed;
\p
\v 10 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded \add us\add* with such things as were necessary.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose ensign was Castor and Pollux.
\p
\v 12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried \add there\add* three days.
\p
\v 13 And from thence, going in a circuitous course, we came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
\p
\v 14 Where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days; and so we went toward Rome.
\p
\v 15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns, whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
\p
\v 16 And when we came to Rome, Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with the soldier that guarded him.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together; and when they were come together, he said unto them: Brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
\p
\v 18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let \add me\add* go, because there was no cause of death in me.
\p
\v 19 But when the Jews spake against \add it,\add* I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught to accuse my nation of.
\p
\v 20 For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and speak with me; because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
\p
\v 21 And they said unto him: We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither did any of the brethren that came hither report or speak any harm of thee.
\p
\v 22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
\p
\v 23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into \add his\add* lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and \add out of\add* the prophets, from morning till evening.
\p
\v 24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
\p
\v 25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word: Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,
\p
\v 26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive;
\p
\v 27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with \add their\add* eyes, and hear with \add their\add* ears, and understand with \add their\add* heart, and should turn again, and I should heal them.
\p
\v 28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and \add that\add* they will hear it.
\p
\v 29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
\p
\v 30 ¶ And he dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
\p
\v 31 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no one hindering him.

\mt3 The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the
\mt1 Romans
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called \add to be\add* an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
\p
\v 2 Which he had promised afore through his prophets in the holy scriptures,
\p
\v 3 Concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh;
\p
\v 4 And declared \add to be\add* the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of the dead; even Jesus Christ, our Lord;
\p
\v 5 Through whom we have received grace and apostleship, unto obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name’s sake;
\p
\v 6 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ;
\p
\v 7 To all that are in Rome, the beloved of God, called \add to be\add* saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 8 ¶ First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
\p
\v 9 For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you, always in my prayers
\p
\v 10 Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.
\p
\v 11 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
\p
\v 12 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
\p
\v 13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was hindered hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as the rest of the Gentiles.
\p
\v 14 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the learned, and to the ignorant.
\p
\v 15 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
\p
\v 16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
\p
\v 17 For therein is a righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The righteous shall live by faith.
\p
\v 18 ¶ For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold down the truth in unrighteousness;
\p
\v 19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath manifested \add it\add* unto them.
\p
\v 20 For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, \add even\add* his eternal power and deity; so that they are without excuse.
\p
\v 21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified \add him\add* not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened.
\p
\v 22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
\p
\v 23 And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
\p
\v 24 ¶ Wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their hearts, to dishonour their bodies among themselves;
\p
\v 25 For that they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
\p
\v 26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile passions; for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature;
\p
\v 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working that which is shameful, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was fit.
\p
\v 28 And even as they refused to retain God in \add their\add* knowledge, God gave them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;
\p
\v 29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
\p
\v 30 Backbiters, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
\p
\v 31 Without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful;
\p
\v 32 Who, knowing the judgment of God, that they that practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
\p
\v 2 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that commit such things.
\p
\v 3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them that do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
\p
\v 4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
\p
\v 5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
\p
\v 6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
\p
\v 7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
\p
\v 8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
\p
\v 9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;
\p
\v 10 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile;
\p
\v 11 For there is no respect of persons with God.
\p
\v 12 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;
\p
\v 13 For not the hearers of the law \add are\add* just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
\p
\v 14 For when the Gentiles, who have no law, do by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law unto themselves;
\p
\v 15 Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and \add their\add* reasonings mutually accusing or even excusing them.
\p
\v 16 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.
\p
\v 17 ¶ But if thou art called a Jew, and restest upon the law, and makest thy boast in God,
\p
\v 18 And knowest \add his\add* will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
\p
\v 19 And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,
\p
\v 20 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who have in the law the outline of knowledge and of the truth.
\p
\v 21 Thou therefore who teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
\p
\v 22 Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples?
\p
\v 23 Thou that boastest in the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
\p
\v 24 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, as it is written.
\p
\v 25 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou fulfillest the law; but if thou art a law-breaker, thy circumcision hath become uncircumcision.
\p
\v 26 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the requirements of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned as circumcision?
\p
\v 27 And shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who, notwithstanding letter and circumcision, art a law-breaker?
\p
\v 28 For he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly; neither \add is that\add* circumcision, which is outward in the flesh;
\p
\v 29 But he \add is\add* a Jew, who is one inwardly; and circumcision \add is\add* of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise \add is\add* not of men, but of God.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision?
\p
\v 2 Much every way: first, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
\p
\v 3 For what if some did not believe? shall their faithlessness destroy God’s faithfulness?
\p
\v 4 God forbid! nay, let God be found true, though every man be false; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
\p
\v 5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousnessof God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who 3taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man.)
\p
\v 6 God forbid! for then how shall God judge the world?
\p
\v 7 But if the truth of God hath abounded through my lie unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?
\p
\v 8 And \add why\add* not, as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say, let us do evil, that good may come? whose judgment is just.
\p
\v 9 ¶ What then? are we better? No, in no wise; for we have before accused both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;
\p
\v 10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one;
\p
\v 11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God;
\p
\v 12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
\p
\v 13 Their throat \add is\add* an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps \add is\add* under their lips;
\p
\v 14 Whose mouth \add is\add* full of cursing and bitterness;
\p
\v 15 Their feet \add are\add* swift to shed blood;
\p
\v 16 Destruction and misery \add are\add* in their ways,
\p
\v 17 And the way of peace have they not known;
\p
\v 18 There is no fear of God before their eyes.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be under judgment to God.
\p
\v 20 Therefore by works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law \add is\add* the knowledge of sin. —
\p
\v 21 ¶ But now, apart from the law, a righteousness of God is manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets;
\p
\v 22 Even a righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all that have faith; for there is no difference;
\p
\v 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
\p
\v 24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
\p
\v 25 Whom God hath set forth a propitiation through faith in his blood, to manifest his righteousness in passing over sins done aforetime in the forbearance of God;
\p
\v 26 To declare, say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.
\p
\v 27 Where \add is\add* boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.
\p
\v 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law.
\p
\v 29 \add Is he\add* the God of Jews only? \add is he\add* not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also;
\p
\v 30 Since God is one, who will justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
\p
\v 31 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid! nay, we establish the law.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
\p
\v 2 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath \add whereof\add* to glory; but not before God.
\p
\v 3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.
\p
\v 4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned as of grace, but as of debt.
\p
\v 5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.
\p
\v 6 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works,
\p
\v 7 \add Saying,\add* Blessed \add are\add* they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
\p
\v 8 Blessed \add is\add* the man to whom the Lord will not reckon sin.
\p
\v 9 \add Cometh\add* this blessedness then upon the circumcision \add only,\add* or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
\p
\v 10 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
\p
\v 11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which \add he had yet\add* being uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be reckoned unto them also;
\p
\v 12 And the father of circumcision to them that not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which \add he had\add* being \add yet\add* uncircumcised.
\p
\v 13 For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed, that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.
\p
\v 14 For if they who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of no effect;
\p
\v 15 Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, \add there is\add* no transgression.
\p
\v 16 Therefore \add it is\add* of faith, that \add it might be\add* by grace; to the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
\p
\v 17 As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations, before him whom he believed, \add even\add* God, who giveth life to the dead, and calleth those things that are not, as though they were.
\p
\v 18 Who, being past hope, believed with hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
\p
\v 19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb;
\p
\v 20 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
\p
\v 21 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
\p
\v 22 And therefore it was reckoned to him for righteousness.
\p
\v 23 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was reckoned to him;
\p
\v 24 But for us also, to whom it shall be reckoned, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
\p
\v 25 Who was delivered up for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;
\p
\v 2 Through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
\p
\v 3 And not only \add so,\add* but we glory in tribulations also; knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
\p
\v 4 And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
\p
\v 5 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit that hath been given unto us.
\p
\v 6 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
\p
\v 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
\p
\v 8 But God commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
\p
\v 9 Much more then, being now justified in his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
\p
\v 10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved through his life.
\p
\v 11 And not only \add so,\add* but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Wherefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all sinned;
\p
\v 13 For prior to the law sin was in the world, but sin is not reckoned when there is no law.
\p
\v 14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him who was to come.
\p
\v 15 But not as the offence, so also \add is\add* the free gift. For if through the offence of one the many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto the many.
\p
\v 16 And not as through one that sinned \add is\add* the gift; for the judgment \add was\add* through one unto condemnation, but the free gift \add is\add* from many offences unto justification.
\p
\v 17 For if by the offence of the one, death reigned by the one, much more they who receive the abundance of the grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 18 Therefore as in result one offence reached unto all men unto condemnation, even so the one righteous act reaches unto all unto justification of life.
\p
\v 19 For as by the one man’s disobedience the many were constituted sinners, so by the obedience of the one shall the many be constituted righteous.
\p
\v 20 Moreover the law came in by the way, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,
\p
\v 21 That as sin hath reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? 
\p
\v 2 God forbid! How shall we, who died to sin, live any longer therein?
\p
\v 3 Know ye not, that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
\p
\v 4 Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead through the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
\p
\v 5 For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall be also \add in the likeness of his\add* resurrection;
\p
\v 6 Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with \add him,\add* that the body of sin might be done away, that we should no longer be enslaved to sin.
\p
\v 7 For he that hath died is acquitted of his sin.
\p
\v 8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him,
\p
\v 9 Knowing that Christ having been raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
\p
\v 10 For the death that he died, he died unto sin once for all, but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
\p
\v 11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but to be living unto God in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey its desires;
\p
\v 13 Neither yield ye your members up \add as\add* instruments of unrighteousness unto sin; but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members \add as\add* instruments of righteousness unto God.
\p
\v 14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
\p
\v 15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid!
\p
\v 16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves as servants to obey, his servants ye are whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness?
\p
\v 17 But God be thanked, that though ye were the servants of sin, ye have obeyed from the heart that form of teaching into which ye were led.
\p
\v 18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
\p
\v 19 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh; for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
\p
\v 20 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free as to righteousness.
\p
\v 21 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things \add is\add* death.
\p
\v 22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
\p
\v 23 For the wages of sin \add is\add* death; but the gift of God \add is\add* eternal life in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
\c 7
\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 ¶ Know ye not, brethren, for I speak to them that know the law, that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
\p
\v 2 For the woman that hath an husband is bound by the law to the husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband is dead, she is loosed from the law of the husband.
\p
\v 3 So then if, while the husband liveth, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if the husband dieth,she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she is married to another man.
\p
\v 4 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, \add even\add* to him who was raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
\p
\v 5 For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
\p
\v 6 But now we have been set free from the law, having died to that wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not \add in\add* the oldness of the letter.
\p
\v 7 ¶ What shall we say then? \add Is\add* the law sin? God forbid! Nay, I had not known sin, but through the law; for I had not known covetousness, if the law had not said, Thou shalt not covet.
\p
\v 8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of evil desire. For apart from the law sin is \add as\add* dead,
\p
\v 9 And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
\p
\v 10 And the commandment, which \add I thought to be\add* unto life, I found \add to be\add* unto death.
\p
\v 11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew \add me.\add* 
\p
\v 12 Wherefore the law \add is\add* holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
\p
\v 13 Did then that which is good become death unto me? God forbid! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death in me through that which is good; that sin through the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
\p
\v 14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am, as fleshly, sold under sin.
\p
\v 15 For that which I do I do not approve; for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
\p
\v 16 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that \add it is\add* good.
\p
\v 17 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
\p
\v 18 For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good dwelleth not; for to will is present with me; but to perform that which is good I find not.
\p
\v 19 For the good that I would I do not, but the evil which I would not, that I do.
\p
\v 20 Now if I do what I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
\p
\v 21 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
\p
\v 22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man;
\p
\v 23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
\p
\v 24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of this body of death?
\p
\v 25 I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
\c 8
\cl CHAPTER 8
\p
\v 1 ¶ \add There is\add* therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and of death.
\p
\v 3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and as an offering for sin, condemned sin in the flesh,
\p
\v 4 That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
\p
\v 5 For they that are living according to the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are living according to the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
\p
\v 6 For the minding of the flesh \add is\add* death, but the minding of the Spirit \add is\add* life and peace.
\p
\v 7 Because the fleshly mind \add is\add* enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be.
\p
\v 8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
\p
\v 9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if it be so that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
\p
\v 10 And if Christ \add is\add* in you, the body \add is\add* reckoned dead because of sin; but the Spirit \add is\add* life because of righteousness.
\p
\v 11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall also give life to your mortal bodies on account of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh:
\p
\v 13 For if ye live according to flesh, ye are about to die; but if ye through the Spirit do put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
\p
\v 14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
\p
\v 15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
\p
\v 16 The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God;
\p
\v 17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with \add him,\add* that we may be also glorified together.
\p
\v 18 ¶ For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time \add are\add* not worthy \add to be compared\add* with the glory which shall be revealed unto us.
\p
\v 19 For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
\p
\v 20 For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath made it subject in hope.
\p
\v 21 For the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
\p
\v 22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
\p
\v 23 And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.
\p
\v 24 For in that hope were we saved; but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
\p
\v 25 But if we hope for what we see not, \add then\add* do we with patience wait for \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity; for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
\p
\v 27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what \add is\add* the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to God.
\p
\v 28 And we know that all things work together for good to those that love God, to those who are the called according to \add his\add* purpose.
\p
\v 29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate \add to be\add* conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
\p
\v 30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
\p
\v 31 What shall we then say to these things? If God \add is\add* for us, who \add can be\add* against us?
\p
\v 32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?
\p
\v 33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? Shall God, that justifieth?
\p
\v 34 Who \add is\add* he that condemneth? \add Is it\add* Christ, who died, yea rather, who is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us?
\p
\v 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? \add shall\add* tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
\p
\v 36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
\p
\v 37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
\p
\v 38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
\p
\v 39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
\c 9
\cl CHAPTER 9
\p
\v 1 ¶ I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,
\p
\v 2 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
\p
\v 3 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh;
\p
\v 4 Who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the law-giving, and the service, and the promises;
\p
\v 5 Whose \add are\add* the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ \add came,\add* who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
\p
\v 6 ¶ Not, however, as though the word of God had failed. For they \add are\add* not all Israel, that are of Israel;
\p
\v 7 Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, \add are they\add* all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
\p
\v 8 That is, They that are the children of the flesh, these \add are\add* not the children of God: but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.
\p
\v 9 For this \add is\add* the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
\p
\v 10 And not only so, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, \add even\add* by our Father Isaac—
\p
\v 11 For \add the children\add* being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth—
\p
\v 12 It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
\p
\v 13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
\p
\v 14 ¶ What shall we say then? \add Is there\add* unrighteousness with God? God forbid!
\p
\v 15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
\p
\v 16 So then \add it is\add* not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God, that showeth mercy.
\p
\v 17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
\p
\v 18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.
\p
\v 19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?
\p
\v 20 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed \add it,\add* Why hast thou made me thus?
\p
\v 21 Hath not the potter authority over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
\p
\v 22 \add What\add* if God, willing to show \add his\add* wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction;
\p
\v 23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,
\p
\v 24 Even us, whom he hath called, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the Gentiles?
\p
\v 25 As he saith also in Hosea, I will call them my people, that were not my people; and her beloved that was not beloved.
\p
\v 26 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* in the place where it was said unto them, Ye \add are\add* not my people; there shall they be called the sons of the living God.
\p
\v 27 Isaiah also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;
\p
\v 28 For he will finish the work, and cut \add it\add* short in righteousness; because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
\p
\v 29 And as Isaiah said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and been made like unto Gomorrah.
\p
\v 30 What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, have obtained righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;
\p
\v 31 But Israel, following after a law for righteousness hath not attained to \add that\add* law.
\p
\v 32 Wherefore? Because \add they sought it\add* it not by faith, but as it were by works. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
\p
\v 33 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stumblingstone and rock of offence, and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
\c 10
\cl CHAPTER 10
\p
\v 1 ¶ Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for them is, that they might be saved.
\p
\v 2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
\p
\v 3 For, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
\p
\v 4 For Christ \add is\add* the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
\p
\v 5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man that doeth those things shall live by them.
\p
\v 6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart. Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down;
\p
\v 7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.
\p
\v 8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, \add even\add* in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is, the word of faith, which we preach:
\p
\v 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
\p
\v 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
\p
\v 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
\p
\v 12 For there is no difference between Jew and Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
\p
\v 13 For, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
\p
\v 14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
\p
\v 15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
\p
\v 16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
\p
\v 17 So then faith \add cometh\add* by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
\p
\v 18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily. Their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the earth.
\p
\v 19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by \add them that are\add* no people, \add and\add* by a foolish nation I will anger you.
\p
\v 20 But Isaiah is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.
\p
\v 21 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
\c 11
\cl CHAPTER 11
\p
\v 1 ¶ I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, \add of\add* the tribe of Benjamin.
\p
\v 2 God hath not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,
\p
\v 3 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
\p
\v 4 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
\p
\v 5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
\p
\v 6 And if by grace, then \add is it\add* no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace. But if \add it is\add* of works, then is it no more grace; otherwise work is no more work.
\p
\v 7 ¶ What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.
\p
\v 8 According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear, unto this day.
\p
\v 9 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them;
\p
\v 10 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.
\p
\v 11 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid! but \add rather\add* through their fall salvation \add is come\add* unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
\p
\v 12 Now if the fall of them is the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulness?
\p
\v 13 ¶ For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office,
\p
\v 14 If by any means I may provoke to emulation \add those who are\add* my flesh, and might save some of them.
\p
\v 15 For if the casting away of them is the reconciling of the world, what \add shall\add* the receiving \add of them be,\add* but life from the dead?
\p
\v 16 For if the firstfruit \add is\add* holy, the lump \add is\add* also \add holy;\add* and if the root \add is\add* holy, so \add are\add* the branches.
\p
\v 17 And if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree:
\p
\v 18 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
\p
\v 19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
\p
\v 20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear;
\p
\v 21 For if God spared not the natural branches, \add take heed\add* lest he also spare not thee.
\p
\v 22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them that fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou shalt abide in \add his\add* goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
\p
\v 23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
\p
\v 24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted, contrary to nature, into a good olive tree, how much more shall these, who are the natural \add branches,\add* be grafted into their own olive tree?
\p
\v 25 ¶ For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part hath happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
\p
\v 26 And so all Israel shall be saved; as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
\p
\v 27 For this \add is\add* my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.
\p
\v 28 As concerning the gospel, \add they are\add* enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, \add they are\add* beloved for the fathers’ sake.
\p
\v 29 For the gifts and calling of God \add are\add* without repentance.
\p
\v 30 For as ye in times past disobeyed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their disobedience,
\p
\v 31 Even so have these also now disobeyed, that through the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.
\p
\v 32 For God hath shut up all under disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.
\p
\v 33 ¶ O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable \add are\add* his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
\p
\v 34 For, Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
\p
\v 35 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
\p
\v 36 For of him, and through him, and to him, \add are\add* all things: to whom \add be\add* glory for ever. Amen.
\c 12
\cl CHAPTER 12
\p
\v 1 ¶ I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, \add which is\add* your reasonable service.
\p
\v 2 And be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
\p
\v 3 ¶ For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think \add of himself\add* more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
\p
\v 4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
\p
\v 5 So we, \add being\add* many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.
\p
\v 6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, \add let us prophesy\add* according to the proportion of faith;
\p
\v 7 Or ministry, \add let us be occupied\add* with the ministry; or he that teacheth, with teaching;
\p
\v 8 Or he that exhorteth, with exhortation; he that giveth, \add let him do it\add* with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.
\p
\v 9 ¶ \add Let\add* love be unfeigned. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
\p
\v 10 \add Be\add* kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
\p
\v 11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
\p
\v 12 Rejoicing in the hope; patient in tribulation; persevering in prayer; 
\p
\v 13 Contributing to the necessity of the saints; given to hospitality.
\p
\v 14 Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.
\p
\v 15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
\p
\v 16 \add Be\add* of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but go along with the lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits.
\p
\v 17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
\p
\v 18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
\p
\v 19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but \add rather\add* give place unto wrath; for it is written, Vengeance \add is\add* mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 20 But, If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
\p
\v 21 Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
\c 13
\cl CHAPTER 13
\p
\v 1 ¶ Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God.
\p
\v 2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist shall receive to themselves condemnation.
\p
\v 3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
\p
\v 4 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is God’s minister, an avenger to \add execute\add* wrath upon him that doeth evil.
\p
\v 5 Wherefore \add ye\add* must needs be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.
\p
\v 6 For for this cause ye pay tribute also; for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
\p
\v 7 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute \add is due;\add* custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
\p
\v 8 Owe no one any thing, except to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
\p
\v 9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if \add there be\add* any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
\p
\v 10 Love worketh no ill to its neighbour: therefore love \add is\add* the fulfilling of the law.
\p
\v 11 This also, knowing the time, that now \add it is\add* high time for you to awake out of sleep; for now \add is\add* our salvation nearer than when we believed.
\p
\v 12 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
\p
\v 13 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
\p
\v 14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for fleshly lusts.
\c 14
\cl CHAPTER 14
\p
\v 1 ¶ Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, \add but\add* not to doubtful disputations.
\p
\v 2 For one believeth that he may eat all things; another, who is weak, eateth only herbs.
\p
\v 3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth; for God hath received him.
\p
\v 4 Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up, for God is able to make him stand.
\p
\v 5 One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every day \add alike.\add* Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind.
\p
\v 6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth \add it\add* unto the Lord; and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
\p
\v 7 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
\p
\v 8 For if we live, we live unto the Lord; and if we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.
\p
\v 9 For to this end Christ both died and lived, that he might be Lord of both dead and living.
\p
\v 10 But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or again, thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.
\p
\v 11 For it is written, \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
\p
\v 12 So then each one of us shall give account concerning himself to God.
\p
\v 13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more; but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in a brother’s way.
\p
\v 14 I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that \add there is\add* nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him \add it is\add* unclean.
\p
\v 15 For if thy brother is grieved because of thy food, thou walkest no longer according to love. Destroy not through thy food him for whom Christ died.
\p
\v 16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of.
\p
\v 17 For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 18 For he that in these things serveth Christ \add is\add* acceptable to God, and approved of men.
\p
\v 19 Let us therefore pursue the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may build up another.
\p
\v 20 For the sake of food do not destroy the work of God. All things indeed \add are\add* clean; but \add it is\add* evil for that man who eateth so as to cause stumbling.
\p
\v 21 \add It is\add* good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor \add any thing\add* whereby thy brother stumbleth.
\p
\v 22 Hast thou faith? have \add it\add* to thyself before God. Happy \add is\add* he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
\p
\v 23 But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because it is not of faith; and whatsoever \add is\add* not of faith is sin.
\c 15
\cl CHAPTER 15
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
\p
\v 2 Let every one of us please \add his\add* neighbour, for \add his\add* good, to upbuilding.
\p
\v 3 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.
\p
\v 4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
\p
\v 5 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus,
\p
\v 6 That ye may with one mind \add and\add* one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.
\p
\v 8 For I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises \add made\add* unto the fathers,
\p
\v 9 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for \add his\add* mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.
\p
\v 10 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
\p
\v 11 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye peoples.
\p
\v 12 And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles hope.
\p
\v 13 Now the God of the hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in the hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 14 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
\p
\v 15 Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,
\p
\v 16 That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might become acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 17 I have therefore whereof I may glory in Christ Jesus in those things which pertain to God.
\p
\v 18 For I will not dare to speak of any except of those things which Christ hath wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
\p
\v 19 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
\p
\v 20 Yea, being ambitious to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation;
\p
\v 21 But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see, and they that have not heard shall understand.
\p
\v 22 For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
\p
\v 23 But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;
\p
\v 24 Whensoever I go unto Spain, I will come to you; for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, after I have first enjoyed being with you for a time.
\p
\v 25 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
\p
\v 26 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints that are at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 27 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.
\p
\v 28 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you unto Spain.
\p
\v 29 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
\p
\v 30 ¶ Now I beseech you, brethren, by the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in \add your\add* prayers to God for me;
\p
\v 31 That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which \add I have\add* for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
\p
\v 32 That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
\p
\v 33 Now the God of peace \add be\add* with you all. Amen.

\cl CHAPTER 16
\p
\v 1 ¶ I commend unto you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchreae:
\p
\v 2 That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in any matter wherein she hath need of you; for she hath been a helper of many, and of myself also.
\p
\v 3 Greet Prisca and Aquila, my helpers in Christ Jesus,
\p
\v 4 Who for my life put in peril their own necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

\p
\v 15 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
\p
\v 16 Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.
\p
\v 17 ¶ Now I beseech you, brethren, mark those who are causing divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the teaching which ye have learned; and avoid them.
\p
\v 18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.
\p
\v 19 For your obedience is come abroad unto all \add men.\add* I am glad therefore on your behalf; but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.
\p
\v 20 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with you. Amen.
\p
\v 21 ¶ Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.

\p
\v 26 But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, is made known unto all nations for the obedience of faith,

\mt3 The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the
\mt1 Corinthians
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Paul, called \add to be\add* an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes \add our\add* brother,
\p
\v 2 Unto the church of God which is at Corinth— the sanctified, called to be saints— with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:
\p
\v 3 Grace \add be\add* unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 4 ¶ I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you in Christ Jesus;
\p
\v 5 That in every thing ye are enriched in him, in all utterance, and \add in\add* all knowledge;
\p
\v 6 Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you;
\p
\v 7 So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ;
\p
\v 8 Who shall also confirm you unto the end, \add that ye may be\add* blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 9 God \add is\add* faithful, by whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
\p
\v 10 ¶ Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and \add that\add* there be no divisions among you; but \add that\add* ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
\p
\v 11 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by those \add of the household\add* of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
\p
\v 12 Now I mean this, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
\p
\v 13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?
\p
\v 14 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
\p
\v 15 Lest any should say that ye were baptized into my name.
\p
\v 16 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
\p
\v 17 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel; not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.
\p
\v 18 ¶ For the message of the cross is to those that perish foolishness; but unto us that are saved it is the power of God.
\p
\v 19 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
\p
\v 20 Where \add is\add* the wise? where \add is\add* the scribe? where \add is\add* the disputant of this age? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
\p
\v 21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those that believe.
\p
\v 22 And although Jews demand signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom,
\p
\v 23 Yet we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumblingblock, and to Gentiles foolishness;
\p
\v 24 But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
\p
\v 25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
\p
\v 26 For see your calling, brethren, how that not many are wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;
\p
\v 27 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
\p
\v 28 And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, \add yea,\add* and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are:
\p
\v 29 That no flesh should glory in God’s presence.
\p
\v 30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who is become unto us wisdom from God; righteousness also, and sanctification, and redemption;
\p
\v 31 That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
\p
\v 2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
\p
\v 3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
\p
\v 4 And my speech and my preaching \add were\add* not with enticing words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
\p
\v 5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
\p
\v 6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among those that are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, that come to naught;
\p
\v 7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, \add even\add* the hidden \add wisdom,\add* which God foreordained before the ages unto our glory;
\p
\v 8 Which none of the rulers of this world knew; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
\p
\v 9 But, as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him,
\p
\v 10 But God hath revealed \add them\add* unto us by the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
\p
\v 11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
\p
\v 12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
\p
\v 13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Spirit teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
\p
\v 14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know \add them,\add* because they are spiritually discerned.
\p
\v 15 But the spiritual man discerneth all things, yet he himself is discerned by no one.
\p
\v 16 For, Who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as unto fleshly, \add even\add* as unto babes in Christ.
\p
\v 2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able \add to bear it,\add* neither yet now are ye able.
\p
\v 3 ¶ For ye are yet fleshly: for whereas \add there is\add* among you envying and strife, are ye not fleshly, and walk according to man?
\p
\v 4 For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I \add am\add* of Apollos; are ye not fleshly?
\p
\v 5 Who then is Paul, and who \add is\add* Apollos, but ministers through whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to each man?
\p
\v 6 I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
\p
\v 7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
\p
\v 8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and each man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour,
\p
\v 9 For we are God’s fellow-workmen; ye are God’s tillage, God’s building.
\p
\v 10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a skilled architect, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
\p
\v 11 For other foundation can no man lay than that that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;
\p
\v 13 Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.
\p
\v 14 If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
\p
\v 15 If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as through fire.
\p
\v 16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and \add that\add* the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
\p
\v 17 If any man destroy the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinketh himself to be wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
\p
\v 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
\p
\v 20 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
\p
\v 21 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
\p
\v 22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours,
\p
\v 23 And ye are Christ’s, and Christ \add is\add* God’s.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
\p
\v 2 Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
\p
\v 3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
\p
\v 4 For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
\p
\v 5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall each man have praise of God.
\p
\v 6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and \add to\add* Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think \add of men\add* beyond that which is written, that ye may not be puffed up for the one against the other.
\p
\v 7 For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive \add it,\add* why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received \add it?\add*
\p
\v 8 Now ye are filled, now ye are become rich, ye have reigned without us! yea, and I would that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
\p
\v 9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle unto the world, both to angels, and to men.
\p
\v 10 We \add are\add* fools for Christ’s sake, but ye \add are\add* wise in Christ! we \add are\add* weak, but ye \add are\add* strong! ye \add are\add* honoured, but we \add are\add* despised.
\p
\v 11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;
\p
\v 12 And labour, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;
\p
\v 13 Being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, unto this day.
\p
\v 14 I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
\p
\v 15 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet \add have ye\add* not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
\p
\v 16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye imitators of me.
\p
\v 17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved child, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
\p
\v 18 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
\p
\v 19 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of those that are puffed up, but the power.
\p
\v 20 For the kingdom of God \add is\add* not in word, but in power.
\p
\v 21 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and the spirit of meekness?
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ It is reported commonly \add that there is\add* fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one hath his father’s wife.
\p
\v 2 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
\p
\v 3 For I verily, being absent in body, but present in spirit, have already, as if present, judged him that hath so done this deed,
\p
\v 4 In the name of our Lord Jesus, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
\p
\v 5 To deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 Your glorying \add is\add* not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
\p
\v 7 Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also, even Christ, hath been sacrificed.
\p
\v 8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened \add bread\add* of sincerity and truth.
\p
\v 9 I wrote unto you, in my epistle, not to company with fornicators;
\p
\v 10 Yet not meaning with the fornicators of this world, or with its covetous men and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
\p
\v 11 But knowing that, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any one that is called a brother is a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one not even to eat.
\p
\v 12 For what have I to do with judging those that are without? do not ye judge those that are within?
\p
\v 13 But those that are without God judgeth. Put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
\p
\v 2 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
\p
\v 3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?
\p
\v 4 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
\p
\v 5 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
\p
\v 6 But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.
\p
\v 7 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?
\p
\v 8 Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that \add your\add* brethren.
\p
\v 9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,
\p
\v 10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 11 And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
\p
\v 12 ¶ All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
\p
\v 13 Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods; but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body \add is\add* not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
\p
\v 14 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.
\p
\v 15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make \add them\add* the members of a harlot? God forbid!
\p
\v 16 What? know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, Two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
\p
\v 17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
\p
\v 18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
\p
\v 19 What? know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom ye have from God, and ye are not your own?
\p
\v 20 For ye were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body.
\c 7
\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: \add It is\add* good for a man not to touch a woman.
\p
\v 2 But on account of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
\p
\v 3 Let the husband render unto the wife her due; and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
\p
\v 4 The wife hath not authority over her own body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband hath not authority over his own body, but the wife.
\p
\v 5 Deprive ye not one another, except with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not through your lack of self-control.
\p
\v 6 But I speak this as a permission, not as a command.
\p
\v 7 For I would that all men were even as I myself. Yet every man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.
\p
\v 8 ¶ Now I say to the unmarried and widows. It is good for them if they abide even as I.
\p
\v 9 But if they have not self-mastery, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn.
\p
\v 10 And unto the married I command, \add yet\add* not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife be separated from \add her\add* husband;
\p
\v 11 But and if she should become separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to \add her\add* husband; and let not the husband put away \add his\add* wife.
\p
\v 12 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is pleased to dwell with him, let him not leave her.
\p
\v 13 And if any wife hath an unbelieving husband, and he is pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
\p
\v 14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother; else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
\p
\v 15 But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such \add cases:\add* but God hath called us to peace.
\p
\v 16 For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save \add thy\add* husband? or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save \add thy\add* wife?
\p
\v 17 Only, as the Lord hath imparted to each man, as God hath called each one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.
\p
\v 18 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
\p
\v 19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
\p
\v 20 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
\p
\v 21 Wast thou called \add being\add* a servant? care not for it: nay, even if thou mayest be made free, use \add it\add* rather.
\p
\v 22 For he that is called in the Lord, \add being\add* a servant, is the Lord’s freeman; likewise also he that is called, \add being\add* free, is Christ’s servant.
\p
\v 23 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
\p
\v 24 Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.
\p
\v 25 ¶ Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
\p
\v 26 I think therefore that this is good because of the present distress, \add I mean\add* that \add it is\add* good for a man to remain as he is.
\p
\v 27 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
\p
\v 28 But if thou shouldst marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have tribulation in the flesh; and I would spare you.
\p
\v 29 But this I say, brethren, the time \add is\add* short; it remaineth that those that have wives may be as though they had none;
\p
\v 30 And those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;
\p
\v 31 And those that use the world, as not using it to the full; for the fashion of this world passeth away.
\p
\v 32 But I would have you without cares. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord;
\p
\v 33 But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please \add his\add* wife.
\p
\v 34 There is difference \add also\add* between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit; but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please \add her\add* husband.
\p
\v 35 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I put constraint upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
\p
\v 36 But if any man think that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of \add her\add* age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.
\p
\v 37 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well.
\p
\v 38 So then he that giveth \add her\add* in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth \add her\add* not in marriage doeth better.
\p
\v 39 A wife is bound as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be fallen asleep, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord.
\p
\v 40 But she is happier if she abide, as she is, according to my judgment; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
\c 8
\cl CHAPTER 8
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.
\p
\v 2 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
\p
\v 3 But if any man love God, the same is known by him.
\p
\v 4 As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol \add is\add* nothing in the world, and that \add there is\add* no other God but one.
\p
\v 5 For though there are that are called gods, whether in heaven or on the earth, (as there are gods many, and lords many,)
\p
\v 6 Yet to us \add there is but\add* one God, the Father, from whom \add are\add* all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom \add are\add* all things, and we through him.
\p
\v 7 Howbeit \add there is\add* not in every man that knowledge: for some, being heretofore accustomed to the idol, eat it as a thing that hath been offered unto an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
\p
\v 8 But food commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; nor, if we eat not, are we the worse.
\p
\v 9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to those that are weak.
\p
\v 10 For if any man see thee that hast knowledge sit at meat in an idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him that is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols?
\p
\v 11 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?
\p
\v 12 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
\p
\v 13 Wherefore, if meat maketh my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to stumble.
\c 9
\cl CHAPTER 9
\p
\v 1 ¶ Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?
\p
\v 2 If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are ye in the Lord.
\p
\v 3 This is my answer to those who examine me.
\p
\v 4 Have we no right to eat and to drink?
\p
\v 5 Have we no right to lead about a wife who is a sister, as well as other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
\p
\v 6 Or only I and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?
\p
\v 7 Who goeth to warfare any time at his own cost? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
\p
\v 8 Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
\p
\v 9 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen God careth,
\p
\v 10 Or saith he \add it\add* altogether for our sake? For our sake, no doubt, \add this\add* is written; that he that ploweth should plow in hope, and he that thresheth, in hope of partaking,
\p
\v 11 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, \add is it\add* a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
\p
\v 12 If others be partakers of \add this\add* right over you, \add are\add* not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this right; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
\p
\v 13 Do ye not know that they that minister about holy things eat from the temple? and they that attend at the altar are partakers with the altar?
\p
\v 14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they that preach the gospel should live by the gospel.
\p
\v 15 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me; for \add it were\add* better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
\p
\v 16 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
\p
\v 17 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward. But if, against my will, still a stewardship is committed unto me.
\p
\v 18 What is my reward then? So that, when I preach the gospel, I will make the gospel of Christ without charge, so as not to press to the full my authority in the gospel.
\p
\v 19 For though I am free from all \add men,\add* yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.
\p
\v 20 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to those that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain those that are under the law;
\p
\v 21 To those that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but lawfully subject to Christ,) that I might gain those that are without law.
\p
\v 22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all, that I might by all means save some.
\p
\v 23 And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with others.
\p
\v 24 Know ye not that they that run in a race all run, but only one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
\p
\v 25 And every contestant in the games is temperate in all things. They, indeed, \add do it\add* to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
\p
\v 26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air;
\p
\v 27 But I buffet my body, and bring \add it\add* into subjection; lest that by any means, after having preached to others, I myself should be disapproved.
\c 10
\cl CHAPTER 10
\p
\v 1 ¶ For I would not that ye should be ignorant, brethren, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; 
\p
\v 2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
\p
\v 3 And did all eat the same spiritual food;
\p
\v 4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
\p
\v 5 But with the most of them God was not well pleased; for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
\p
\v 6 Now these things happened as types for us, that we should not Mesire evil things, as they also desired.
\p
\v 7 Neither be ye idolaters, as \add were\add* some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
\p
\v 8 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
\p
\v 9 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.
\p
\v 10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.
\p
\v 11 Now all these things happened unto them as types, and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.
\p
\v 12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
\p
\v 13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man; but God \add is\add* faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear \add it\add*.
\p
\v 14 ¶ Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
\p
\v 15 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
\p
\v 16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
\p
\v 17 For we \add being\add* many are one bread, \add and\add* one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread.
\p
\v 18 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
\p
\v 19 What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
\p
\v 20 Nay, but that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God; and I would not that ye should have fellowship with demons.
\p
\v 21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of demons.
\p
\v 22 Are we to provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we mightier than he?
\p
\v 23 All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable; all things are lawful, but not all things build up.
\p
\v 24 Let no man seek his own \add advantage,\add* but that of the other.
\p
\v 25 Whatsoever is sold in the market eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake;
\p
\v 26 For, The earth \add is\add* the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.
\p
\v 27 If an unbeliever gives you an invitation, and ye are disposed to go, whatsoever is set before you eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake.
\p
\v 28 But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience’ sake; for, The earth \add is\add* the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.
\p
\v 29 Conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s. But why is my liberty judged by another’s conscience?
\p
\v 30 If I partake with thanks, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
\p
\v 31 Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
\p
\v 32 Give no cause of offence, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God;
\p
\v 33 Even as I please all in all things, not seeking my own profit, but that of the many, that they may be saved.

\cl CHAPTER 11
\p
\v 1 ¶ Be ye followers of me, even as I also \add am\add* of Christ.
\p
\v 2 ¶ Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the instructions I delivered to you.
\p
\v 3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman \add is\add* the man, and the head of Christ \add is\add* God.
\p
\v 4 Every man praying or prophesying, having \add his\add* head covered, dishonoureth his head.
\p
\v 5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with \add her\add* head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
\p
\v 6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
\p
\v 7 For a man indeed ought not to cover \add his\add* head, forasmuch as he is God’s image and glory, but the woman is man’s glory.
\p
\v 8 For man is not from woman, but woman from man.
\p
\v 9 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
\p
\v 10 For this cause ought the woman to have the token of authority on the head, because of the angels.
\p
\v 11 However, in the Lord neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman.
\p
\v 12 For as the woman is from the man, even so also the man is by the woman; but all things are from God.
\p
\v 13 Judge in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
\p
\v 14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
\p
\v 15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her; for \add her\add* hair is given her for a covering.
\p
\v 16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
\p
\v 17 ¶ Now in giving you the following charge I praise \add you\add* not, in that ye meet together not for the better, but for the worse.
\p
\v 18 For first of all, I hear that when ye meet together in assembly, there are schisms among you; and I partly believe it.
\p
\v 19 For there must be also heresies among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.
\p
\v 20 When ye come together therefore into one place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper.
\p
\v 21 For, in eating, each one taketh before others his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
\p
\v 22 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put to shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise \add you\add* not.
\p
\v 23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus, the \add same\add* night in which he was betrayed, took bread;
\p
\v 24 And when he had given thanks, he brake \add it,\add* and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me.
\p
\v 25 After the same manner also \add he took\add* the cup, when they had supped, saying. This cup is the new covenant in my blood; this do ye, as oft as ye drink \add it,\add* in remembrance of me.
\p
\v 26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink \add this\add* cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.
\p
\v 27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
\p
\v 28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
\p
\v 29 For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh a judgment to himself, if he discern not the Lord’s body.
\p
\v 30 For this cause many \add are\add* weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
\p
\v 31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
\p
\v 32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
\p
\v 33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another.
\p
\v 34 If any one is hungry, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto a judgment. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
\c 12
\cl CHAPTER 12
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now concerning spiritual \add gifts,\add* brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
\p
\v 2 Ye know that when ye were Gentiles, ye were carried away unto dumb idols, in whatever way ye might be led.
\p
\v 3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no one speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
\p
\v 5 And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord.
\p
\v 6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God that worketh all things in all.
\p
\v 7 But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit.
\p
\v 8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another, the word of knowledge, by the same Spirit;
\p
\v 9 To another, faith, by the same Spirit; to another, gifts of healing, by the same Spirit;
\p
\v 10 To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, various kinds of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues:
\p
\v 11 But all these things the one and the same Spirit worketh, distributing to each severally as he will.
\p
\v 12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also \add is\add* the Christ.
\p
\v 13 For by one Spirit have we all been baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and have been all made to drink of one Spirit.
\p
\v 14 For the body is not one member, but many.
\p
\v 15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
\p
\v 16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
\p
\v 17 If the whole body \add were\add* an eye, where \add were\add* the hearing? If the whole \add were\add* hearing, where \add were\add* the smelling?
\p
\v 18 But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
\p
\v 19 And if they were all one member, where \add were\add* the body?
\p
\v 20 But now are the members many, but the body one.
\p
\v 21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
\p
\v 22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary;
\p
\v 23 And those \add parts\add* of the body, which we deem to be more void of honour, these we clothe with more abundant honour; and our uncomely \add parts\add* have more abundant comeliness,
\p
\v 24 Whereas our comely \add parts\add* have no need. But God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that \add part\add* which lacked,
\p
\v 25 That there should be no schism in the body; but \add that\add* the members should have the same care one for another.
\p
\v 26 And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
\p
\v 27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
\p
\v 28 And God hath set some in the church: first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, various kinds of tongues.
\p
\v 29 \add Are\add* all apostles? \add are\add* all prophets? \add are\add* all teachers? \add are\add* all workers of miracles?
\p
\v 30 Have all gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
\p
\v 31 But desire earnestly the greater gifts; and yet show I unto you a more excellent way.
\c 13
\cl CHAPTER 13
\p
\v 1 ¶ Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become \add as\add* sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.
\p
\v 2 And though I have \add the gift of\add* prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.
\p
\v 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed \add the poor,\add* and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing.
\p
\v 4 Love suffereth long, \add and\add* is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
\p
\v 5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh net its own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
\p
\v 6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
\p
\v 7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
\p
\v 8 Love never faileth; but whether \add there be\add* prophecies, they shall fail; whether \add there be\add* tongues, they shall cease; whether \add there be\add* knowledge, it shall vanish away.
\p
\v 9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
\p
\v 10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
\p
\v 11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
\p
\v 12 For now we see as through a glass, dimly; but then face to face; now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
\p
\v 13 And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these \add is\add* love.
\c 14
\cl CHAPTER 14
\p
\v 1 ¶ Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual \add gifts,\add* but chiefly that ye may prophesy.
\p
\v 2 For he that speaketh in an \add unknown\add* tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God, for no one understandeth; but in spirit he speaketh mysteries.
\p
\v 3 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men \add to\add* edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
\p
\v 4 He that speaketh in an \add unknown\add* tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
\p
\v 5 Now I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied; for greater \add is\add* he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
\p
\v 6 And now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or prophecy, or in teaching?
\p
\v 7 And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
\p
\v 8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
\p
\v 9 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.
\p
\v 10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them \add is\add* without signification.
\p
\v 11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh \add shall be\add* a barbarian unto me.
\p
\v 12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual \add gifts,\add* seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.
\p
\v 13 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an \add unknown\add* tongue pray that he may interpret.
\p
\v 14 For if I pray in an \add unknown\add* tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
\p
\v 15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
\p
\v 16 Else when thou shalt bless with the Spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
\p
\v 17 For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
\p
\v 18 I thank God, I speak with tongues more than ye all;
\p
\v 19 Yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an \add unknown\add* tongue.
\p
\v 20 Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit in malice be ye babes, but in understanding be men.
\p
\v 21 In the law it is written, By other tongues and strange lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 22 So that tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; while prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for believers.
\p
\v 23 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in \add those that are\add* unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
\p
\v 24 But if all prophesy, and there come in an unbeliever, or \add one\add* unlearned, he is convicted of all, he is judged of all;
\p
\v 25 And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on \add his\add* face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.
\p
\v 26 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, each hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.
\p
\v 27 If any man speak in an \add unknown\add* tongue, \add let it be\add* two, or at the most three, and \add that\add* in turn; and let one interpret.
\p
\v 28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
\p
\v 29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge.
\p
\v 30 But if there be a revelation to another that sitteth by, let the first be silent.
\p
\v 31 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be encouraged.
\p
\v 32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
\p
\v 33 For he is not the God of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
\p
\v 34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak, but to be in subjection, as also saith the law.
\p
\v 35 And if they wish to learn any thing, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.
\p
\v 36 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you alone?
\p
\v 37 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.
\p
\v 38 But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
\p
\v 39 Wherefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
\p
\v 40 Let all things be done decently and in order.
\c 15
\cl CHAPTER 15
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
\p
\v 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, unless indeed ye have believed in vain.
\p
\v 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
\p
\v 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures;
\p
\v 5 And that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
\p
\v 6 Then he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
\p
\v 7 Then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles.
\p
\v 8 And last of all he appeared to me also, as to one born out of due time.
\p
\v 9 For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
\p
\v 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am; and his grace which was toward me hath not been in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
\p
\v 11 Therefore whether it be I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
\p
\v 12 Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
\p
\v 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ hath not been raised;
\p
\v 14 And if Christ hath not been raised, then \add is\add* our preaching vain, and your faith \add is\add* also vain.
\p
\v 15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified concerning God that he raised up Christ; whom he raised not up, if it be so that the dead are not raised.
\p
\v 16 For if the dead are not raised, then Christ hath not been raised;
\p
\v 17 And if Christ hath not been raised, your faith \add is\add* vain; ye are yet in your sins.
\p
\v 18 Then they also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
\p
\v 19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.
\p
\v 20 But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those fallen asleep.
\p
\v 21 For since by man \add came\add* death, by man \add came\add* also the resurrection of the dead.
\p
\v 22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
\p
\v 23 But each in his own rank: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ’s at his coming.
\p
\v 24 Then, finally, when he delivereth up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he has done away every rule, and every authority and power,
\p
\v 25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet,
\p
\v 26 The last enemy, death, is destroyed.
\p
\v 27 For, He hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith that all things are subjected, \add it is\add* manifest that he is excepted, who subjected all things to him.
\p
\v 28 And when all things shall be subjected to him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.
\p
\v 29 Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for them?
\p
\v 30 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
\p
\v 31 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
\p
\v 32 If, to speak after the manner of men, I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me, if the dead rise not? Let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.
\p
\v 33 Be not deceived; evil communications corrupt good morals,
\p
\v 34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some are ignorant of God; I speak \add this\add* to your shame.
\p
\v 35 ¶ But some one will say. How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
\p
\v 36 Foolish one! that which thou sowest is not made alive, except it die;
\p
\v 37 And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other;
\p
\v 38 But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed its own body.
\p
\v 39 All flesh \add is\add* not the same flesh; but \add there is\add* one flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of birds, \add and\add* another of fishes.
\p
\v 40 \add There are\add* also heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly \add is\add* one, and that of the earthly \add is\add* another.
\p
\v 41 \add There is\add* one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for \add one\add* star differeth from \add another\add* star in glory.
\p
\v 42 Thus also \add is\add* the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;
\p
\v 43 It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
\p
\v 44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
\p
\v 45 And so it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam \add is\add* a life-giving spirit.
\p
\v 46 Howbeit that \add was\add* not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
\p
\v 47 The first man was of the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven.
\p
\v 48 As \add is\add* the earthy, such \add are\add* they also that are earthy; and as \add is\add* the heavenly, such \add are\add* they also that are heavenly.
\p
\v 49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
\p
\v 50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
\p
\v 51 Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
\p
\v 52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
\p
\v 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal \add must\add* put on immortality.
\p
\v 54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
\p
\v 55 O death, where \add is\add* thy sting? O grave, where \add is\add* thy victory?
\p
\v 56 The sting of death \add is\add* sin; and the power of sin \add is\add* the law.
\p
\v 57 But thanks \add be\add* to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
\c 16
\cl CHAPTER 16
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.
\p
\v 2 Upon the first \add day\add* of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he is prospered, that there may be no collections when I come.
\p
\v 3 And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters to convey your gift to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 4 And if it be desirable that I go also, they shall go with me.
\p
\v 5 Now I will come unto you, when I have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia.
\p
\v 6 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.
\p
\v 7 For I will not see you now in passing; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
\p
\v 8 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
\p
\v 9 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and \add there are\add* many adversaries.
\p
\v 10 Now if Timothy come, see that he may be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also \add do.\add*
\p
\v 11 Let no man therefore despise him; but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
\p
\v 12 As touching \add our\add* brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
\p
\v 13 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
\p
\v 14 Let all things be done by you in love.
\p
\v 15 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is a firstfruit of Achaia, and \add that\add* they have devoted themselves to the saints for service,)
\p
\v 16 That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work.
\p
\v 17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
\p
\v 18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore recognize them that are such.
\p
\v 19 ¶ The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
\p
\v 20 All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.
\p
\v 21 The salutation of \add me,\add* Paul, with my own hand.
\p
\v 22 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Our Lord cometh!
\p
\v 23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with you.
\p
\v 24 My love \add be\add* with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.

\mt3 The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the
\mt1 Corinthians
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy the brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:
\p
\v 2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 3 Blessed \add be\add* the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
\p
\v 4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any tribulation, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
\p
\v 5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound toward us, so through Christ our consolation also aboundeth.
\p
\v 6 And if we are in tribulation, it is for your consolation and salvation, wrought in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer; or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.
\p
\v 7 And our hope of you \add is\add* stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the consolation.
\p
\v 8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our tribulation, which came to us in Asia, that we were greatly oppressed, beyond our strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life;
\p
\v 9 Yea, we had the sentence of death within our own selves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead;
\p
\v 10 Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver; in whom we hope that he will yet deliver;
\p
\v 11 Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift \add bestowed\add* upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.
\p
\v 12 ¶ For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
\p
\v 13 For we write no other things unto you, but what ye well know and recognize, and I hope ye will recognize to the end;
\p
\v 14 As also ye have recognized us partially, that we are your boast, even as ye also \add are\add* ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;
\p
\v 16 And to pass by you unto Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and by you to be set forward on my way toward Judaea.
\p
\v 17 When I therefore was thus minded, did I suse levity? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea, yea, and nay, nay?
\p
\v 18 But God is faithful, that our word unto you is not yea and nay.
\p
\v 19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, \add even\add* by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but with him is yea.
\p
\v 20 For all the promises of God in him have their yea, and through him their Amen, unto the glory of God through us.
\p
\v 21 Now he who establisheth us with you into Christ, and hath anointed us, \add is\add* God;
\p
\v 22 Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
\p
\v 23 But I call upon God as a witness to my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.
\p
\v 24 Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy; for by faith ye stand.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow.
\p
\v 2 For if I grieve you, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same that is grieved through me?
\p
\v 3 And I have written this very thing, that when I come I may not have grief from those from whom I ought to have joy j having confidence in you all, that my joy is that of you all.
\p
\v 4 For out of much tribulation and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have very abundantly unto you.
\p
\v 5 But if any have caused grief, he hath not caused grief to me, but in part (that I may not be too severe) to you all.
\p
\v 6 Sufficient to such a one is this censure, which was of the many.
\p
\v 7 So that, on the other hand, ye should rather show grace, and encourage such a one, lest perhaps he should be swallowed up with excessive grief.
\p
\v 8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye will confirm your love toward him.
\p
\v 9 For to this end also have I written, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.
\p
\v 10 To whom ye forgive any thing, I also forgive; for if I have forgiven any thing, I have forgiven it for your sakes, in the presence of Christ;
\p
\v 11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
\p
\v 12 Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened unto me in the Lord,
\p
\v 13 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.
\p
\v 14 Now thanks be unto God, who always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge through us in every place.
\p
\v 15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish;
\p
\v 16 To the one a savour of death unto death, to the other a savour of life unto life. And who \add is\add* sufficient for these things?
\p
\v 17 For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some, letters of commendation to you, or from you?
\p
\v 2 Ye are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men;
\p
\v 3 Manifestly shown to be Christ’s letter, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on fleshy tables of the heart.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And such trust have we through Christ toward God:
\p
\v 5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;
\p
\v 6 Who also hath made us sufficient ministers of the new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.
\p
\v 7 But if the ministration of death, engraved with letters on stones, began with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily into the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which was passing away:
\p
\v 8 How shall not rather the ministration of the Spirit be with glory?
\p
\v 9 For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
\p
\v 10 For even that which was made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the surpassing glory.
\p
\v 11 For if that which is done away was with glory, much more that which remaineth is in glory.
\p
\v 12 Seeing then that we have such hope, we exercise much confidence;
\p
\v 13 And not as Moses, \add who\add* put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel should not fix their eyes on the end of that which was passing away.
\p
\v 14 But their minds were blinded; for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old covenant, which is done away in Christ.
\p
\v 15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil lieth upon their heart.
\p
\v 16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.
\p
\v 17 Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord \add is,\add* there \add is\add* liberty.
\p
\v 18 But we all, with unveiled face reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
\p
\v 2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.
\p
\v 3 But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to them that are lost;
\p
\v 4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine forth.
\p
\v 5 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.
\p
\v 6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to \add give\add* the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 7 ¶ But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassing greatness of the power may be of God, and not from us.
\p
\v 8 \add We are\add* troubled on every side, yet not distressed; \add we are\add* perplexed, but not in despair;
\p
\v 9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
\p
\v 10 Always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
\p
\v 11 For we who live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
\p
\v 12 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
\p
\v 13 And having the same Spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;
\p
\v 14 Knowing that he that raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also through Jesus, and shall present \add us\add* with you.
\p
\v 15 For all things \add are\add* for your sake, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.
\p
\v 16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward \add man\add* is renewed day by day.
\p
\v 17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding \add and\add* eternal weight of glory;
\p
\v 18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen \add are\add* temporal; but the things which are not seen \add are\add* eternal.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ For we know that if our earthly house of \add this\add* tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
\p
\v 2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
\p
\v 3 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
\p
\v 4 For we that are in \add this\add* tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
\p
\v 5 Now he that hath wrought us for this very thing \add is\add* God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
\p
\v 6 Therefore \add we are\add* always confident, knowing that, whilst present in the body, we are absent from the Lord;
\p
\v 7 For we walk by faith, not by sight;
\p
\v 8 We are confident, \add I say,\add* and well-pleased rather to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.
\p
\v 9 Wherefore it is our ambition that, whether present or absent, we may be well-pleasing to him.
\p
\v 10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things \add done\add* in \add his\add* body, according to that he hath done, whether \add it be\add* good or bad.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but to God we have been manifested, and I hope also that we have been manifested in your consciences.
\p
\v 12 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to \add answer\add* them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.
\p
\v 13 For if we are beside ourselves, \add it is\add* to God; or if we are of sound mind, \add it is\add* for you.
\p
\v 14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all died;
\p
\v 15 And he died for all, that they who live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him who died for them, and rose again.
\p
\v 16 Wherefore henceforth know we no man according to the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now henceforth know we \add him\add* so no more.
\p
\v 17 Therefore if any one is in Christ, \add he is\add* a new creature; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new;
\p
\v 18 And all things \add are\add* of God, who hath reconciled us to himself through Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
\p
\v 19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
\p
\v 20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech \add you\add* by us: we pray \add you\add* in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.
\p
\v 21 Him who knew no sin he made to be sin for us, that we might become in him the righteousness of God.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ We then, \add as\add* workers together \add with him,\add* beseech \add you\add* also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
\p
\v 2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in a day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now \add is\add* the accepted time; behold, now \add is\add* the day of salvation.)
\p
\v 3 Giving no cause of stumbling in any thing, that the service be not blamed;
\p
\v 4 But in all \add things\add* proving ourselves to be God’s servants, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
\p
\v 5 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
\p
\v 6 In pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
\p
\v 7 In the word of truth, in the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
\p
\v 8 Through honour and dishonour, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, and \add yet\add* true;
\p
\v 9 As unknown, and \add yet\add* well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
\p
\v 10 As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and \add yet\add* possessing all things.
\p
\v 11 ¶ O \add ye\add* Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.
\p
\v 12 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections.
\p
\v 13 Now for a recompence in kind (I speak as unto \add my\add* children,) be ye also enlarged.
\p
\v 14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
\p
\v 15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath a believer with an unbeliever?
\p
\v 16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in \add them;\add* and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\p
\v 17 Wherefore, Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean \add thing;\add* and I will receive you,
\p
\v 18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
\c 7
\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 ¶ Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
\p
\v 2 ¶ Receive us; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have defrauded no one.
\p
\v 3 I speak not to condemn, for I have already said that ye are in our hearts, to die together and live together.
\p
\v 4 Great \add is\add* my boldness toward you, great \add is\add* my glorying of you. I am filled with encouragement, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.
\p
\v 5 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without \add were\add* fightings, within \add were\add* fears.
\p
\v 6 Nevertheless God, who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
\p
\v 7 And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.
\p
\v 8 For though I made you sorry by my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret; for I perceive that that letter \add it was\add* that made you sorry, (though only for a season).
\p
\v 9 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance; for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that in nothing ye might receive harm from us.
\p
\v 10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
\p
\v 11 For behold this very thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, \add what\add* clearing of yourselves, yea, \add what\add* indignation, yea, \add what\add* fear, yea, \add what\add* vehement desire, yea, \add what\add* zeal, yea, \add what\add* doing of justice ! In all \add things\add* ye have shown yourselves to be clear in this matter.
\p
\v 12 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, \add I did it\add* not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.
\p
\v 13 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more we rejoiced in our comfort because of the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
\p
\v 14 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which \add I made\add* before Titus, is found a truth.
\p
\v 15 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
\p
\v 16 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all \add things\add*.
\c 8
\cl CHAPTER 8
\p
\v 1 ¶ Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
\p
\v 2 How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
\p
\v 3 For to \add their\add* power, I bear testimony, yea, and beyond \add their\add* power \add they were\add* willing of themselves;
\p
\v 4 Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and \add take upon us\add* the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
\p
\v 5 And \add this they did,\add* not as we expected, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
\p
\v 6 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.
\p
\v 7 Therefore, as ye abound in every \add thing, in\add* faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and \add in\add* all diligence, and \add in\add* your love to us, \add see\add* that ye abound in this grace also.
\p
\v 8 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
\p
\v 9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
\p
\v 10 And herein I give \add my\add* advice; for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
\p
\v 11 Now therefore finish the doing \add of it;\add* that as \add there was\add* a readiness to will, so \add there may be\add* a finishing according to that which ye have.
\p
\v 12 For if there be first a willing mind, \add it is\add* accepted according to that a man hath, \add and\add* not according to that he hath not.
\p
\v 13 For \add I mean\add* not that other men be eased, and ye burdened;
\p
\v 14 But by an equality, \add that\add* now at this time your abundance \add may be a supply\add* for their want, and that their abundance may become \add a supply\add* for your want; that there may be equality:
\p
\v 15 As it is written, He that \add had gathered\add* much had nothing over; and he that \add had gathered\add* little had no lack.
\p
\v 16 But thanks \add be\add* to God, who put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
\p
\v 17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being very zealous, of his own accord he went unto you.
\p
\v 18 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches;
\p
\v 19 And not \add that\add* only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this gift, which is administered by us with a view to the Lord’s glory and our earnest desire;
\p
\v 20 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us as to this bounty which is administered by us;
\p
\v 21 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
\p
\v 22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, through the great confidence he has toward you.
\p
\v 23 As to Titus, \add he is\add* my partner and fellowhelper in your behalf. As to our brethren, \add they are\add* the messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.
\p
\v 24 Wherefore show ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
\c 9
\cl CHAPTER 9
\p
\v 1 ¶ For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you.
\p
\v 2 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath stirred up very many.
\p
\v 3 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready;
\p
\v 4 Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
\p
\v 5 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, which hath been so much spoken of before, that the same might be ready, as \add a matter of\add* bounty, and not as \add of\add* constraint.
\p
\v 6 But this I say, He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully;
\p
\v 7 Let each one do according as lie purposeth in his heart; not grudgingly, or of necessity, for God loveth a cheerful giver.
\p
\v 8 And God \add is\add* able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all \add things,\add* may abound to every good work;
\p
\v 9 As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.
\p
\v 10 And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;
\p
\v 11 Ye being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.
\p
\v 12 For the ministration of this service not only supplieth the wants of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;
\p
\v 13 While by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your acknowledged submission unto the gospel of the Christ, and for \add your\add* liberal contribution unto them, and unto all;
\p
\v 14 And by their prayer for you, who long after you because of the exceeding grace of God in you.
\p
\v 15 Thanks \add be\add* unto God for his unspeakable gift!
\c 10
\cl CHAPTER 10
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence \add am\add* base among you, but being absent am bold toward you;
\p
\v 2 But I beseech \add you,\add* that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
\p
\v 3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh;
\p
\v 4 (For the weapons of our warfare \add are\add* not fleshly, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
\p
\v 5 Overthrowing reasonings, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and leading captive every thought into the obedience of Christ;
\p
\v 6 And having a readiness to avenge every disobedience, when your obedience is made complete.
\p
\v 7 Do ye look on things according to the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself consider this again, that, as he \add is\add* Christ’s, even so \add are\add* we Christ’s.
\p
\v 8 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for building you up, and not for casting you down, I should not be ashamed;
\p
\v 9 That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
\p
\v 10 For \add his\add* letters, says one, \add are\add* weighty and powerful; but \add his\add* bodily presence \add is\add* weak, and \add his\add* speech contemptible.
\p
\v 11 Let such a one consider this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such \add will we be\add* also in deed when we are present.
\p
\v 12 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves; but they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
\p
\v 13 But we will not boast of things beyond \add our\add* measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
\p
\v 14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond \add our measure,\add* as though we reached not unto you; for we came as far as to you also in \add preaching\add* the gospel of Christ;
\p
\v 15 Not boasting beyond \add our\add* measure in other men’s labours; but having hope, that when your faith is increased, we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,
\p
\v 16 To preach the gospel in the \add regions\add* beyond you, \add and\add* not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.
\p
\v 17 But, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
\p
\v 18 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER II
\p
\v 1 ¶ Would that ye could bear with me a little in \add my\add* folly! and indeed bear with me.
\p
\v 2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present \add you as\add* a chaste virgin to Christ.
\p
\v 3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity which is in Christ.
\p
\v 4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we preached not, or \add if\add* ye receive another spirit, which ye received not, or a different gospel, which ye accepted not, ye might well bear with me.
\p
\v 5 But I suppose that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
\p
\v 6 And though \add I be\add* rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things.
\p
\v 7 Have I committed sin in humbling myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God without cost?
\p
\v 8 I robbed other churches, taking wages \add of them,\add* to do you service.
\p
\v 9 And when I was present with you, and lacked, I was chargeable to no one, for that which was lacking to me the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied; and in all \add things\add* I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep \add myself.\add* 
\p
\v 10 As the truth of Christ is in me, no one shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
\p
\v 11 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
\p
\v 12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
\p
\v 13 For such \add are\add* false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
\p
\v 14 And no marvel; for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.
\p
\v 15 Therefore \add it is\add* no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
\p
\v 16 ¶ I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
\p
\v 17 That which I speak, I speak \add it\add* not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
\p
\v 18 Seeing that many glory according to the flesh, I will glory also.
\p
\v 19 For ye bear with fools gladly, seeing ye \add yourselves\add* are wise !
\p
\v 20 For ye bear it if one bring you into bondage, if one devour you, if one take from you, if one exalt himself, if one smite you on the face!
\p
\v 21 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.
\p
\v 22 Are they Hebrews? so \add am\add* I. Are they Israelites? so \add am\add* I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so \add am\add* I.
\p
\v 23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I \add am\add* more; in labours more abundantly, in prisons more frequently, in stripes beyond counting, in deaths oft.
\p
\v 24 Of the Jews five times received I forty \add stripes\add* save one.
\p
\v 25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
\p
\v 26 \add In\add* journeyings often, \add in\add* perils of rivers, \add in\add* perils of robbers, \add in\add* perils from \add my own\add* countrymen, \add in\add* perils from the Gentiles, \add in\add* perils in the city, \add in\add* perils in the wilderness, \add in\add* perils in the sea, \add in\add* perils among false brethren;
\p
\v 27 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
\p
\v 28 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, care for all the churches.
\p
\v 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
\p
\v 30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities.
\p
\v 31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus, who is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
\p
\v 32 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king put guards about the city of the Damascenes, seeking to arrest me;
\p
\v 33 And through a window, in a basket, was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
\c 12
\cl CHAPTER 12
\p
\v 1 ¶ It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
\p
\v 2 I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell; God knoweth;) such a one caught up to the third heaven.
\p
\v 3 And I know such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell; God knoweth;)
\p
\v 4 That he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
\p
\v 5 Of such a one will I glory; yet of myself I will not glory, except in my infirmities.
\p
\v 6 For though I should desire to glory, I should not be a fool, for I should be speaking the truth; but I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me \add to be,\add* or \add that\add* he heareth of me.
\p
\v 7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
\p
\v 8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
\p
\v 9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power is fulfilled in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
\p
\v 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
\p
\v 11 ¶ I am become foolish; ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.
\p
\v 12 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
\p
\v 13 For what is there wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not a charge to you? forgive me this wrong!
\p
\v 14 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a charge to you; for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
\p
\v 15 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you. If I love you more abundantly, am I to be loved the less?
\p
\v 16 But be it so, I was not myself a charge to you; nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile!
\p
\v 17 Did I make gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
\p
\v 18 I requested Titus to go, and with \add him\add* I sent a brother. Did Titus make gain of you? walked we not in the same Spirit? \add walked we\add* not in the same steps?
\p
\v 19 Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but \add we do\add* all things, dearly beloved, for your upbuilding.
\p
\v 20 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and \add that\add* I shall be found by you such as ye would not; lest \add there be\add* debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;
\p
\v 21 \add And\add* lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and \add that\add* I shall bewail many who have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
\c 13
\cl CHAPTER 13
\p
\v 1 ¶ This \add is\add* the third \add time\add* I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
\p
\v 2 I told you before, and foretell you, as when I was present the second time; so also now being absent I write to those who heretofore have sinned, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare;
\p
\v 3 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which toward you is not weak, but is powerful in you.
\p
\v 4 For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him through the power of God toward you.
\p
\v 5 Examine yourselves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Do you not yourselves recognize that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
\p
\v 6 But I hope that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
\p
\v 7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.
\p
\v 8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
\p
\v 9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong; and this also we pray for, \add even\add* your perfecting.
\p
\v 10 Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the authority which the Lord hath given me for building up, and not casting down.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfected, be comforted, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
\p
\v 12 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
\p
\v 13 ¶ All the saints salute you.
\p
\v 14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, \add be\add* with you all.

\mt3 The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the
\mt1 Galatians
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Paul, an apostle, not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;
\p
\v 2 And all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
\p
\v 3 Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
\p
\v 4 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of the present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:
\p
\v 5 To whom \add be\add* glory for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 6 ¶ I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel;
\p
\v 7 Which is not another; but there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
\p
\v 8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
\p
\v 9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.
\p
\v 10 ¶ For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the sservant of Christ.
\p
\v 11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not according to man.
\p
\v 12 For I neither received it from man, neither was I taught \add it,\add* but by a revelation of Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 13 For ye have heard of my manner of life formerly in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it;
\p
\v 14 And advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my time in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers
\p
\v 15 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called \add me\add* by his grace,
\p
\v 16 To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood;
\p
\v 17 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
\p
\v 18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.
\p
\v 19 But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.
\p
\v 20 Now as to the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
\p
\v 21 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
\p
\v 22 And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ;
\p
\v 23 But they had heard only, That he that persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.
\p
\v 24 And they glorified God in me.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with \add me\add* also.
\p
\v 2 And I went up according to a revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them that were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.
\p
\v 3 But not even Titus, being a Greek, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised;
\p
\v 4 And as for the false brethren, brought in unawares, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;
\p
\v 5 We never subjected ourselves to them for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
\p
\v 6 But from those reputed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me, God accepteth not man’s person,) to me those who seemed of repute imparted nothing.
\p
\v 7 But, on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as that of the circumcision unto Peter;
\p
\v 8 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)
\p
\v 9 And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we \add should\add* go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision;
\p
\v 10 Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
\p
\v 11 But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.
\p
\v 12 For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision.
\p
\v 13 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
\p
\v 14 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before all, thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
\p
\v 15 We, being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
\p
\v 16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but only through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
\p
\v 17 But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also have been found sinners, is therefore Christ a minister of sin? God forbid!
\p
\v 18 But if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
\p
\v 19 For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God.
\p
\v 20 I have been crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
\p
\v 21 I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness \add come\add* by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ Foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified?
\p
\v 2 This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by works of law, or by the hearing of faith?
\p
\v 3 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
\p
\v 4 Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if indeed it be in vain.
\p
\v 5 He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, \add doeth he it\add* by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
\p
\v 6 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Know ye therefore that they that are of faith, these are Abraham’s sons.
\p
\v 8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, preached beforehand the gospel unto Abraham, \add saying,\add* In thee shall all nations be blessed.
\p
\v 9 So then they that are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.
\p
\v 10 But as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
\p
\v 11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, \add it is\add* evident: for, The just shall live by faith;
\p
\v 12 And the law is not of faith; but. The man that doeth them shall live by them.
\p
\v 13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed \add is\add* every one that hangeth on a tree;
\p
\v 14 That the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
\p
\v 15 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men. Even a man’s covenant once confirmed no one setteth aside, or addeth thereto,
\p
\v 16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
\p
\v 17 And this I say, \add that\add* the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot annul, that it should make the promise of no effect.
\p
\v 18 For if the inheritance is of the law, \add it is\add* no more of promise; but God gave \add it\add* to Abraham by promise.
\p
\v 19 Wherefore then \add serveth\add* the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; \add and it was\add* ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator.
\p
\v 20 Now a mediator is not \add a mediator\add* of one, but God is one.
\p
\v 21 \add Is\add* the law then against the promises of God? God forbid! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by that law.
\p
\v 22 But the scripture hath shut up all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
\p
\v 23 ¶ But before faith came, we were confined under law, shut up unto the faith about to be revealed.
\p
\v 24 Wherefore the law was our tutor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
\p
\v 25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor.
\p
\v 26 For ye are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 27 For all ye who were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.
\p
\v 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 29 And if ye \add are\add* Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now I say, \add That\add* the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
\p
\v 2 But is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed of the father.
\p
\v 3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the principles of the world;
\p
\v 4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
\p
\v 5 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
\p
\v 6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
\p
\v 7 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
\p
\v 8 ¶ Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them that by nature are no gods.
\p
\v 9 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly principles, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?
\p
\v 10 Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.
\p
\v 11 I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Brethren, I beseech you, be as I \add am;\add* for I \add am\add* as ye \add are.\add* Ye have not injured me at all.
\p
\v 13 Nay, ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.
\p
\v 14 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, \add even\add* as Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if \add it had been\add* possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.
\p
\v 16 Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
\p
\v 17 They zealously seek you, \add but\add* not well; yea, they would shut you out, that ye might zealously seek them.
\p
\v 18 But \add it is\add* good to be zealously sought always in what is right, and not only when I am present with you.
\p
\v 19 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,
\p
\v 20 I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.
\p
\v 21 ¶ Tell me, ye that desire to be under law, do ye not hear the law?
\p
\v 22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
\p
\v 23 But he \add who was\add* of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman \add was\add* by promise.
\p
\v 24 Which things are an allegory: for these are two covenants; the one from mount Sinai, gendering to bondage, wliich is Hagar.
\p
\v 25 For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, for she is in bondage with her children.
\p
\v 26 But the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.
\p
\v 27 For it is written, Rejoice, \add thou\add* barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for the desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband.
\p
\v 28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.
\p
\v 29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him \add that was born\add* after the Spirit, even so \add it is\add* now.
\p
\v 30 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.
\p
\v 31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the freewoman.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with a yoke of bondage.
\p
\v 2 ¶ Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye become circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
\p
\v 3 And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised, that he is debtor to do the whole law.
\p
\v 4 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.
\p
\v 5 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
\p
\v 6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.
\p
\v 7 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
\p
\v 8 This persuasion \add cometh\add* not of him that calleth you.
\p
\v 9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
\p
\v 10 I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded; but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
\p
\v 11 And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? for then hath the stumblingblock of the cross been taken away.
\p
\v 12 I would that they who are unsettling you would even cut off themselves.
\p
\v 13 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only \add use\add* not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
\p
\v 14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, \add even\add* in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
\p
\v 15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
\p
\v 16 Now I say, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the desire of the flesh.
\p
\v 17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye may not do the things that ye would.
\p
\v 18 But if ye are led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
\p
\v 19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are \add these;\add* Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
\p
\v 20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
\p
\v 21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I tell you beforehand, as I have also told \add you\add* in time past, that they that do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
\p
\v 23 Meekness, self-control. Against such there is no law.
\p
\v 24 And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
\p
\v 25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
\p
\v 26 Let us not become vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye that are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
\p
\v 2 Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
\p
\v 3 For if any one thinketh himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
\p
\v 4 But let each one prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
\p
\v 5 For each one shall bear his own burden.
\p
\v 6 Let him that is taught in the word share in all good things with him that teacheth.
\p
\v 7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
\p
\v 8 Because he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
\p
\v 9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
\p
\v 10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all, but especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
\p
\v 11 Ye see with what large letters I have written unto you with my own hand.
\p
\v 12 As many as wish to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
\p
\v 13 For neither do they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but they wish to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
\p
\v 14 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
\p
\v 15 For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
\p
\v 16 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
\p
\v 17 Henceforth let no one trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with your spirit. Amen.

\mt3 The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the
\mt1 Ephesians
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:
\p
\v 2 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 3 ¶ Blessed \add be\add* the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly \add places\add* in Christ:
\p
\v 4 According as he chose us in him before the foundation of the: world, that we should be holy and without blame before him;
\p
\v 5 Having in love predestinated us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
\p
\v 6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
\p
\v 7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace,
\p
\v 8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
\p
\v 9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself,
\p
\v 10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; \add even\add* in him:
\p
\v 11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:
\p
\v 12 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who before had hoped in Christ.
\p
\v 13 In whom ye also having heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: and having also believed in him, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
\p
\v 14 Who is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
\p
\v 15 ¶ Wherefore I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,
\p
\v 16 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
\p
\v 17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:
\p
\v 18 The eyes of your heart being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
\p
\v 19 And what the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
\p
\v 20 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set \add him\add* at his own right hand in the heavenly \add places,\add* 
\p
\v 21 Far above all principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come;
\p
\v 22 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him \add to be\add* the head over all things to the church,
\p
\v 23 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ And you hath he made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins,
\p
\v 2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience;
\p
\v 3 Among whom also we all had our manner of life in times past in the desires of our flesh, doing the will of the flesh and the thoughts, and were by nature children of - wrath, even as others.
\p
\v 4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
\p
\v 5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath given us life together with Christ, (by grace ye have been saved;)
\p
\v 6 And raised \add us\add* up with him, and seated \add us\add* with him, in the heavenly \add places\add* in Christ Jesus;
\p
\v 7 That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in \add his\add* kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 8 For by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; \add it is\add* the gift of God:
\p
\v 9 Not of works, lest any one should boast.
\p
\v 10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God made ready beforehand that we should walk in them.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Wherefore remember, that formerly ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision, in the flesh made by hands;
\p
\v 12 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.
\p
\v 13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who once were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
\p
\v 14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition \add between us;\add* 
\p
\v 15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, the law of commandments in ordinances, that he might make of the two, one new man in himself, so making peace;
\p
\v 16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby.
\p
\v 17 And he came and preached peace to you who were afar off, and to them that were nigh.
\p
\v 18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
\p
\v 19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God,
\p
\v 20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner-stone,
\p
\v 21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
\p
\v 22 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, —
\p
\v 2 If indeed ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me toward you,
\p
\v 3 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,
\p
\v 4 Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
\p
\v 5 Which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
\p
\v 6 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel;
\p
\v 7 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me according to the working of his power.
\p
\v 8 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
\p
\v 9 And to make all see what \add is\add* the dispensation of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
\p
\v 10 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in the heavenly \add places\add* might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
\p
\v 11 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
\p
\v 12 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
\p
\v 13 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
\p
\v 14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
\p
\v 15 From whom every family in heaven and earth is named,
\p
\v 16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
\p
\v 17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
\p
\v 18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what \add is\add* the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
\p
\v 19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might he filled, even to all the fulness of God.
\p
\v 20 ¶ Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,

\v 21 Unto him \add be\add* glory in the church in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye are called,
\p
\v 2 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love;
\p
\v 3 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
\p
\v 4 \add There is\add* one body, and one Spirit, even as ye have been called in one hope of your calling;
\p
\v 5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,
\p
\v 6 One God and Father of all, who \add is\add* above all, and through all, and in all.
\p
\v 7 But unto each one of us hath been given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
\p
\v 8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.
\p
\v 9 (Now that he ascended, what is it unless that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
\p
\v 10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)
\p
\v 11 And he hath given some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
\p
\v 12 Unto the perfecting of the saints for the doingof service, for the building up of the body of Christ;
\p
\v 13 Till we all come unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a complete man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ;
\p
\v 14 That we may be no longer babes, tossed like a wave, and carried about with every wind of teaching, by the artifice of men in cunning craftiness, according to wily error;
\p
\v 15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, who is the head, even Christ; 
\p
\v 16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the working of each single part in its measure, maketh increase of the body unto the upbuilding of itself in love.
\p
\v 17 ¶ This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye should no longer walk as the Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,
\p
\v 18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart;
\p
\v 19 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
\p
\v 20 But ye have not so learned Christ,
\p
\v 21 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, according as the truth is in Jesus;
\p
\v 22 That ye put off as concerns your former manner of life the old man, who is corrupted according to the deceitful - desires;
\p
\v 23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
\p
\v 24 And that ye put on the new man, who after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
\p
\v 25 ¶ Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.
\p
\v 26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath;
\p
\v 27 Neither give place to the devil.
\p
\v 28 Let him that steals steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with \add his\add* hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.
\p
\v 29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good for needful building up, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
\p
\v 30 And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, by whom ye have been sealed unto the day of redemption.
\p
\v 31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice;
\p
\v 32 And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ hath forgiven you.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
\p
\v 2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God, for a sweet-smelling savour.
\p
\v 3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
\p
\v 4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor ribaldry, which are not becoming; but rather giving of thanks.
\p
\v 5 For this know ye assuredly, that no fornicator; nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
\p
\v 6 Let no one deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.
\p
\v 7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
\p
\v 8 For ye were at one time darkness, but now are \add ye\add* light in the Lord: walk as children of light;
\p
\v 9 For the fruit of the Spirit consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth;
\p
\v 10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
\p
\v 11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
\p
\v 13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
\p
\v 14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
\p
\v 15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
\p
\v 16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
\p
\v 17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord \add is.\add* 
\p
\v 18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
\p
\v 19 Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
\p
\v 20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
\p
\v 21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
\p
\v 22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
\p
\v 23 For a husband is head of the wife, even as Christ is head of the church; and he is the saviour of the body.
\p
\v 24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so \add let\add* the wives \add be\add* to their own husbands in every thing.
\p
\v 25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
\p
\v 26 That he might sanctify it, cleansing it with the washing of water by the word,
\p
\v 27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
\p
\v 28 So ought husbands to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
\p
\v 29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church;
\p
\v 30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
\p
\v 31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
\p
\v 32 This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
\p
\v 33 Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife \add see\add* that she reverence \add her\add* husband.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
\p
\v 2 Honour thy father and mother —which is the first commandment with promise —
\p
\v 3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
\p
\v 4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to anger, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
\p
\v 5 Servants, be obedient to them that are \add your\add* masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
\p
\v 6 Not with eye-service, as menpleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
\p
\v 7 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men;
\p
\v 8 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any one doeth, that shall he receive from the Lord, whether bond or free.
\p
\v 9 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.
\p
\v 10 ¶ Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
\p
\v 11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
\p
\v 12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the princes of this present world, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly \add realm.\add*
\p
\v 13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
\p
\v 14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
\p
\v 15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
\p
\v 16 In addition to all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.
\p
\v 17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
\p
\v 18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints;
\p
\v 19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
\p
\v 20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds; that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
\p
\v 21 ¶ But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things;
\p
\v 22 Whom I have sent unto you for this very thing, that ye might know our affairs, and \add that\add* he might encourage your hearts.
\p
\v 23 ¶ Peace to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 24 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.

\mt3 The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the
\mt1 Philippians
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
\p
\v 2 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
\p
\v 4 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
\p
\v 5 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
\p
\v 6 Being confident of this very thing, that he who hath begun a good work in you will perfect it unto the day of Jesus Christ;
\p
\v 7 And it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my imprisonment, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all share in grace with me.
\p
\v 8 For God is my witness, how greatly I long after you all in the tender love of Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all perception;
\p
\v 10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and blameless unto the day of Christ;
\p
\v 11 Being filled with the fruit of righteousness, which is through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
\p
\v 12 ¶ But I would have you understand, brethren, that my affairs have really tended to the progress of the gospel;
\p
\v 13 So that my bonds for Christ are manifest in all Caesar’s court, and to all others.
\p
\v 14 And most of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
\p
\v 15 Some indeed preach Christ even through envy and strife; but some also through good will;
\p
\v 16 These indeed out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the vindication of the gospel;
\p
\v 17 But the others out of contention, not sincerely, thinking to add affliction to my bonds.
\p
\v 18 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
\p
\v 19 For I know that this shall result in my deliverance through your prayer and the bountiful grace of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
\p
\v 20 According to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but \add that\add* with all boldness, as always, \add so\add* now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.
\p
\v 21 For to me to live \add is\add* Christ, and to die \add is\add* gain,
\p
\v 22 But whether this life in the flesh shall be the fruit of my labour, or what I should choose, I know not.
\p
\v 23 For I am in a strait betwixt the two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better:
\p
\v 24 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh \add is\add* more needful on your account.
\p
\v 25 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your advancement and joy in the faith;
\p
\v 26 That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Christ Jesus for me through my coming to you again.
\p
\v 27 Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ; that whether I come and see you, or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
\p
\v 28 And in nothing terrified by the adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.
\p
\v 29 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
\p
\v 30 Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear \add to be\add* in me.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ If \add there be\add* therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender affections and mercies,
\p
\v 2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, \add being\add* of one accord, of one mind.
\p
\v 3 \add Let\add* nothing \add be done\add* through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than himself.
\p
\v 4 Look not each one on his own things, but each one also on the things of others.
\p
\v 5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,
\p
\v 6 Who, being in the form of God, did not reckon his equality with God a thing to be clung to;
\p
\v 7 But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men;
\p
\v 8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
\p
\v 9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him that name which is above every name;
\p
\v 10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth;
\p
\v 11 And \add that\add* every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ \add is\add* Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,
\p
\v 13 For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to perform, according to his good pleasure.
\p
\v 14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings;
\p
\v 15 That ye may be blameless and harmless, children of God without reproach, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world,
\p
\v 16 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
\p
\v 17 But even if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
\p
\v 18 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
\p
\v 19 ¶ But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
\p
\v 20 For I have no one likeminded, who will sincerely care for your state.
\p
\v 21 For all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
\p 
\v 22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with a father, he hath; served with me in the gospel.
\p
\v 23 Him therefore I hope to send immediately, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
\p
\v 24 I am assured, however, in the Lord, that I also myself shall come shortly.
\p
\v 25 Yet I deemed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and fellowworkman, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger and minister to my needs: 
\p
\v 26 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because ye had heard that he was sick.
\p
\v 27 And indeed he was sick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
\p
\v 28 I sent him therefore the more eagerly, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
\p
\v 29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in honour;
\p
\v 30 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, that he might make up for that which was lacking in your ministry toward me.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To be writing the same things to you, to me \add is\add* not burdensome, while for you \add it is\add* safe.
\p
\v 2 ¶ Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision.
\p
\v 3 For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
\p
\v 4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
\p
\v 5 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
\p
\v 6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
\p
\v 7 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
\p
\v 8 And furthermore, I consider all things to be loss for the sake of the surpassing knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord; for whomlhave suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may win Christ,
\p
\v 9 And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God, through faith;
\p
\v 10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
\p
\v 11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection from the dead.
\p
\v 12 Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended but \add this\add* one thing; forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
\p
\v 14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
\p
\v 16 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk in the same steps.
\p
\v 17 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark those who so walk as ye have us for an example.
\p
\v 18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, \add that they are\add* the enemies of the cross of Christ;
\p
\v 19 Whose end \add is\add* destruction, whose god \add is their\add* belly, and \add whose\add* glory \add is\add* in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
\p
\v 20 For our citizenship is in the heavens; from whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ;
\p
\v 21 Who shall transform lothe body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorified body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ Therefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, beloved.
\p
\v 2 I beseech Euodia and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
\p
\v 3 And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow, help them; for they laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellowlabourers, whose names \add are\add* in the book of life.
\p
\v 4 Rejoice in the Lord alway; \add and\add* again I say, Rejoice.
\p
\v 5 Let your gentleness be known unto all men. The Lord \add is\add* at hand.
\p
\v 6 Be not anxious about any thing; but in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God;
\p
\v 7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things \add are\add* honest, whatsoever things \add are\add* just, whatsoever things \add are\add* pure, whatsoever things \add are\add* lovely, whatsoever things \add are\add* of good report; if \add there be\add* any virtue, and if \add there be\add* any praise, think on these things.
\p
\v 9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do; and the God of peace shall be with you.
\p
\v 10 ¶ But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now, after so long a time, your thought for me hath revived; though ye were indeed thoughtful, but ye lacked opportunity.
\p
\v 11 Not that I speak in respect of want; for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content.
\p
\v 12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I possess the secret both to be full or to be hungry, to abound and to suffer need.
\p
\v 13 I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.
\p
\v 14 Notwithstanding, ye have done well, that ye did share with me in my affliction.
\p
\v 15 And ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed trom Macedonia, no church shared with me, in the way of giving and receiving, but ye only;
\p
\v 16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
\p
\v 17 Not that I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
\p
\v 18 But I have all, and abound: I am fully supplied, having received of Epaphroditus the things from you, an odour of a sweet savour, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.
\p
\v 19 And my God shall supply all your need, according to his riches in glory, in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 20 Now unto our God and Father \add be\add* glory for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 21 ¶ Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me salute you.
\p
\v 22 All the saints salute you, particularly those who are of yCassar’s household.
\p
\v 23 ¶ The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with you all. Amen.

\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy the brother,
\p
\v 2 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ at Colossae: Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 3 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
\p
\v 4 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love \add which ye have\add* to all the saints,
\p
\v 5 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;
\p
\v 6 Which is come unto you, as \add it is\add* in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as also among you, since the day ye heard, and knew the grace of God in truth;
\p
\v 7 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;
\p
\v 8 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
\p
\v 9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard \add it,\add* do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
\p
\v 10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
\p
\v 11 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;
\p
\v 12 Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;
\p
\v 13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated \add us\add* into the kingdom of his dear Son;
\p
\v 14 In whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins;
\p
\v 15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;
\p
\v 16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him;
\p
\v 17 And he is before all things, and by him all things hold together.
\p
\v 18 And he is the head of the body, the church; who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all \add things\add* he might have the preeminence.
\p
\v 19 For it pleased \add the Father\add* that in him should all fulness dwell;
\p
\v 20 And by him to reconcile all things to himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, \add I say,\add* whether the things on the earth, or things in the heavens.
\p
\v 21 And you, who once were alienated and enemies in \add your\add* mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
\p
\v 22 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight;
\p
\v 23 If indeed ye abide in the faith grounded and settled, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard, which was preached in the whole creation under the heavens; whereof I Paul am made a minister;
\p
\v 24 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church;
\p
\v 25 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which was given to me for you, to fully preach the word of God;
\p
\v 26 \add Even\add* the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints;
\p
\v 27 To whom God would make known among the Gentiles what \add is\add* the riches of the glory of this mystery; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory;
\p
\v 28 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;
\p
\v 29 To which end I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ For I wish you to know what great conflict I have for you, and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
\p
\v 2 That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God, even Christ,
\p
\v 3 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
\p
\v 4 And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
\p
\v 5 For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.
\p
\v 6 ¶ As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him;
\p
\v 7 Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
\p
\v 8 Beware lest any one make you a prey through philosophy and vain deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the principles of the world, and not according to Christ.
\p
\v 9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
\p
\v 10 And ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power;
\p
\v 11 In whom also ye have been circumcised with a circumcision not done with hands, in putting off the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;
\p
\v 12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye have been raised with \add him,\add* through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
\p
\v 13 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he brought to life together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
\p
\v 14 Blotting out the handwriting in ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
\p
\v 15 \add And\add* having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
\p
\v 16 Let no one therefore judge you in food, or in drink, or in respect of a feast, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath;
\p
\v 17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the substance is Christ’s.
\p
\v 18 Let no one defraud you of your reward by a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
\p
\v 19 And not holding fast the Head, from which all the body, by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.
\p
\v 20 ¶ Wherefore if ye died with Christ from the principles of the world, why, as though living in the world, do ye put yourselves under ordinances,
\p
\v 21 Touch not, taste not, handle not —
\p
\v 22 Which are all to perish with the using; after the commandments and doctrines of men?
\p
\v 23 Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in self-imposed service, and humiliations, and neglect of the body; but are without value, except for satisfying the flesh.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
\p
\v 2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
\p
\v 3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
\p
\v 4 When Christ, \add who is\add* our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
\p
\v 5 ¶ Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
\p
\v 6 For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the sons of disobedience;
\p
\v 7 In which ye also once walked, when ye lived among them.
\p
\v 8 But now put ye off also all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
\p
\v 9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
\p
\v 10 And have put on the new, which is renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of him that created him;
\p
\v 11 Wherein there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond \add nor\add* free: but Christ \add is\add* all, and in all.
\p
\v 12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, tender-heartedness, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
\p
\v 13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any one have a grievance against another; even as Christ forgave you, so also \add do\add* ye
\p
\v 14 And over all these \add put on\add* love, which is the perfect bond of union.
\p
\v 15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also ye have been called in one body; and be ye thankful.
\p
\v 16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another; in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
\p
\v 17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, \add do\add* all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father by him.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.
\p
\v 19 Husbands, love \add your\add* wives, and be not bitter against them.
\p
\v 20 Children, obey \add your\add* parents in all things, for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.
\p
\v 21 Fathers, provoke not your children, lest they be discouraged.
\p
\v 22 Servants, obey in all things \add your\add* masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as menpleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God:
\p
\v 23 And whatsoever ye do, do \add it\add* heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
\p
\v 24 Knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance; for ye serve the Lord Christ.
\p
\v 25 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done; and there is no respect of persons.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ Masters, give unto \add your\add* servants that which is just and equitable; knowing that ye also have a Master, in heaven.
\p
\v 2 ¶ Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
\p
\v 3 Withal praying also for us, that God may open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;
\p
\v 4 That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
\p
\v 5 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.
\p
\v 6 Let your speech \add be\add* alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.
\p
\v 7 ¶ All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, the beloved brother, and faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord;
\p
\v 8 Whom I have sent unto you for this purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;

\mt3 The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the
\mt1 Thessalonians
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 2 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
\p
\v 3 Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;
\p
\v 4 Knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election.
\p
\v 5 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
\p
\v 6 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit;
\p
\v 7 So that ye were examples to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
\p
\v 8 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.
\p
\v 9 For they themselves relate, with regard to us, what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,
\p
\v 10 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus, our Deliverer from the wrath to come.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ For ye yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
\p
\v 2 But even after we had suffered before, and were shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi,we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God iwith much contention.
\p
\v 3 For our exhortation \add was\add* not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile;
\p
\v 4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who trieth our hearts.
\p
\v 5 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak for covetousness; God \add is\add* witness;
\p
\v 6 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor \add yet\add* of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.
\p
\v 7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her own children;
\p
\v 8 So, being affectionately desirous of you, it was our joy to impart unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.
\p
\v 9 For ye rernember, brethren, our labour and travail. Labouring night and day, not to be chargeable to any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
\p
\v 10 Ye \add are\add* witnesses, and God \add also,\add* how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe;
\p
\v 11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father his own children,
\p
\v 12 That ye should walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.
\p
\v 13 ¶ For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received \add it\add* not \add as\add* the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also worketh in you that believe.
\p
\v 14 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which are in Judaea, in Christ Jesus; and ye have also suffered like things from your own countrymen, even as they from the Jews;
\p
\v 15 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men;
\p
\v 16 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway; for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
\p
\v 17 ¶ But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
\p
\v 18 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
\p
\v 19 For what \add is\add* our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? \add Are\add* not even ye, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, at his coming?
\p
\v 20 For ye are our glory and joy.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;
\p 
\v 2 And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith;
\p
\v 3 That no man should be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
\p
\v 4 For verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
\p
\v 5 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter had tempted you, and our labour be in vain.
\p
\v 6 But now, when Timothy came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also \add to see\add* you;
\p
\v 7 Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you, in all our affliction and distress, by your faith;
\p
\v 8 For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
\p
\v 9 For what thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sake before our God;
\p
\v 10 Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
\p
\v 11 Now God himself, even our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.
\p
\v 12 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all, even as we toward you:
\p
\v 13 To the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ Furthermore, then, we beseech you, brethren, and exhort \add you\add* by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received from us how ye ought to walk and to please God, as also ye are walking, \add so\add* ye would abound more and more.
\p
\v 2 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 3 For this is the will of God, \add even\add* your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication;
\p
\v 4 That each one of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honour,
\p
\v 5 Not in passionate desire, even as the Gentiles who know not God,
\p
\v 6 Not over-reaching and defrauding his brother in the matter; because the Lord \add is\add* the avenger of all such, as also we have forewarned you and testified.
\p
\v 7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
\p
\v 8 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 9 But as touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another;
\p
\v 10 And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren in all Macedonia; but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;
\p
\v 11 And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
\p
\v 12 That ye may walk a honestly toward them that are without, and \add that\add* ye may have lack of nothing.
\p
\v 13 ¶ But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others who have no hope.
\p
\v 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also that sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
\p
\v 15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive \add and\add* remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not go before them that are asleep.
\p
\v 16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
\p
\v 17 Then we that are alive \add and\add* remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
\p
\v 18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
\p
\v 2 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
\p
\v 3 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
\p
\v 4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
\p
\v 5 For all ye are sons of the light, and sons of the day; we are not of night, nor of darkness.
\p
\v 6 Therefore let us not sleep, as others; but let us watch and be sober.
\p
\v 7 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
\p
\v 8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
\p
\v 9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
\p
\v 10 Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
\p
\v 11 Wherefore comfort one another, and build up one another, even as also ye do.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labour among you, and are over you, in the Lord, and admonish you;
\p
\v 13 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.
\p
\v 14 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn the unruly, encourage the timid, support the weak, be patient toward all.
\p
\v 15 See that no one renders evil for evil unto any; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all.
\p
\v 16 Rejoice evermore.
\p
\v 17 Pray without ceasing.
\p
\v 18 In every thing give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
\p
\v 19 Quench not the Spirit.
\p
\v 20 Despise not prophesyings,
\p
\v 21 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
\p
\v 22 Abstain from every form of evil.
\p
\v 23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 24 Faithful \add is\add* he that calleth you, who also will do \add it\add*.
\p
\v 25 ¶ Brethren, pray for us.
\p
\v 26 ¶ Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.
\p
\v 27 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
\p
\v 28 ¶ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with you. Amen.

\v 6 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
\p
\v 7 And to you who are troubled, rest, with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
\p
\v 8 In flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ;
\p
\v 9 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
\p
\v 10 When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that have believed (for our testimony among you was believed) in that day.
\p
\v 11 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of \add this\add* calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of \add his\add* goodness, and the work of faith with power;
\p
\v 12 That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now we beseech you, brethren, as touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together unto him,
\p
\v 2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of the Lord hath come.
\p
\v 3 Let no one deceive you by any means; for \add that day shall not come,\add* except there come first the apostasy, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
\p
\v 4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God. or that is worshipped; so that he as God, sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God.
\p
\v 5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
\p
\v 6 And now ye know what hindereth, that he may be revealed in his own time.
\p
\v 7 For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work; only there is one who hindereth until he is taken out of the way.
\p
\v 8 And then shall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming;
\p
\v 9 \add Even him,\add* whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
\p
\v 10 And with all the delusions of unrighteousness for them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
\p
\v 11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie;
\p
\v 12 That they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
\p
\v 13 ¶ But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth;
\p
\v 14 Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 15 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the things which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.
\p
\v 16 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, who hath loved us, and hath given \add us\add* everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,
\p
\v 17 Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run, and be glorified, even as also with you;
\p
\v 2 And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for not all have faith.
\p
\v 3 But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep \add you\add* from the evil one.
\p
\v 4 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do, and will do, the things which we command you.
\p
\v 5 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
\p
\v 6 ¶ Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not according to the truth which ye received of us.
\p
\v 7 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us; because we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
\p
\v 8 Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nothings but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you;
\p
\v 9 Not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an example unto you, that ye should follow us.
\p
\v 10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.
\p
\v 11 For we hear that there are some who walk among you, disorderly, working not at all, but are busy-bodies.
\p
\v 12 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
\p
\v 13 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
\p
\v 14 And if any one obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
\p
\v 15 Yet count \add him\add* not as an enemy, but admonish \add him\add* as a brother.
\p
\v 16 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord \add be\add* with you all.
\p
\v 17 ¶ The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every epistle; so I write.
\p
\v 18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with you all. Amen.

\mt3 The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to
\mt1 Timothy
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶  Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the commandment of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope;
\p
\v 2 Unto Timothy, \add my\add* own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
\p
\v 3 ¶ Even as I besought thee to remain at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some not to teach other doctrines,
\p
\v 4 Neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than God’s stewardship which is in faith.
\p
\v 5 Now the object of that charge is love out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned;
\p
\v 6 From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
\p
\v 7 Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they strenuously affirm.
\p
\v 8 But we know that the law \add is\add* good, if a man use it lawfully;
\p
\v 9 Knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinful, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
\p
\v 10 For fornicators, for sodomites, for enslavers, for liars, for perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching,
\p
\v 11 According to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
\p
\v 12 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, that he counted me faithful, putting me into service,
\p
\v 13 Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and insolent; but mercy was shown me because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
\p
\v 14 And the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly, with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 15 This \add is\add* a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
\p
\v 16 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief Christ Jesus might show forth all his longsuffering, for a pattern to those who should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
\p
\v 17 Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, \add be\add* honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 18 This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies as to thee preceding, that thou by them mightest war the good warfare;
\p
\v 19 Holding faith, and a good conscience, which some, having put away, have, concerning the faith, made shipwreck;
\p
\v 20 Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, \add and\add* giving of thanks, be made for all men;
\p
\v 2 For kings and all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
\p
\v 3 For this \add is\add* good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
\p
\v 4 Who would have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
\p
\v 5 For \add there is\add* one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
\p
\v 6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
\p
\v 7 Whereunto I have been appointed a preacher and apostle, (I speak truly, I lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
\p
\v 8 I will therefore that the men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath or doubting.
\p
\v 9 In like manner also, that the women clothe themselves in seemly apparel, with modesty and discretion; not with pleatings, and gold, or pearls, or costly array;
\p
\v 10 But, as becometh women professing godliness, with good works,
\p
\v 11 Let the woman learn in quietness with all subjection.
\p
\v 12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over man, but to be in quietness.
\p
\v 13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve;
\p
\v 14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was involved in transgression.
\p
\v 15 Notwithstanding she shall be preserved through child-bearing, if they abide in faith and love and holiness with discretion.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ Faithful is the word. If any one idesireth the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
\p
\v 2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, discreet, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt in teaching;
\p
\v 3 Not given to wine, or to blows; but patient, not a brawler, not a lover of money;
\p
\v 4 One that ruleth well his own house; having children in subjection with all gravity;
\p
\v 5 For if one knoweth not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?
\p
\v 6 Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
\p
\v 7 Moreover he must be well spoken of by those that are without; lest he fall into reproach and a snare of the devil.
\p
\v 8 Likewise \add must\add* the deacons \add be\add* grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not seeking gain by base means;
\p
\v 9 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
\p
\v 10 And let these also first be proved; then let them serve as deacons, if they are without blame.
\p
\v 11 Women likewise must be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.
\p
\v 12 Let deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
\p
\v 13 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 14 These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:
\p
\v 15 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
\p
\v 16 And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of demons;
\p
\v 2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared;
\p
\v 3 Forbidding to marry, \add and commanding\add* to abstain from foods which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of those who believe and know the truth.
\p
\v 4 For every creature of God \add is\add* good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
\p
\v 5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
\p
\v 6 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished with the words of the faith, and of the good teaching which thou hast strictly followed.
\p
\v 7 But avoid profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself unto godliness.
\p
\v 8 For bodily exercise profiteth for a little: but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
\p
\v 9 This \add is\add* a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
\p
\v 10 For to this end we labour and suffer reproach, because we hope in a living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of those that believe.
\p
\v 11 ¶ These things command and teach.
\p
\v 12 Let no one despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.
\p
\v 13 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
\p
\v 14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
\p
\v 15 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
\p
\v 16 Take heed to thyself, and to the teaching; persevere in these things; for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ Rebuke not an elder, but exhort \add him\add* as a father; younger men as brethren;
\p
\v 2 Elder women as mothers; younger women as sisters, with all purity.
\p
\v 3 Honour widows that are widows indeed.
\p
\v 4 But if any widow have children or descendants, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents; for that is good and acceptable before God.
\p
\v 5 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
\p
\v 6 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
\p
\v 7 And these things charge, that they may be blameless.
\p
\v 8 But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
\p
\v 9 Let a widow be put on the list, being not under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,
\p
\v 10 Well reported of for good works; if she hath brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she hath washed the saints’ feet, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath diligently followed every good work.
\p
\v 11 But younger widows refuse; for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they wish to marry;
\p
\v 12 Exposing themselves to condemnation because they have cast off their first faith.
\p
\v 13 And withal they learn \add to be\add* idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tatlers also and busy-bodies, speaking things which they ought not.
\p
\v 14 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, giving no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.
\p
\v 15 For some have already turned aside after Satan.
\p
\v 16 If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let such relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
\p
\v 17 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and teaching.
\p
\v 18 For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer \add is\add* worthy of his reward.
\p
\v 19 Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
\p
\v 20 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
\p
\v 21 I charge \add thee\add* before God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without pre-judgment, doing nothing by partiality.
\p
\v 22 Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins; keep thyself pure.
\p
\v 23 Drink no longer water only, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thy frequent ailments.
\p
\v 24 Some men’s sins are open beforehand, leading on unto judgment; with some, however, they even follow after.
\p
\v 25 Likewise also the works that are good are manifest beforehand; and those that are otherwise cannot be hid.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ Let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and the teaching be not blasphemed.
\p
\v 2 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather serve them because they are believing and beloved, who profit by the good and ready service. These things teach and exhort.
\p
\v 3 ¶ If any one teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the teaching which is according to godliness;
\p
\v 4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
\p
\v 5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness.
\p
\v 6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.
\p
\v 7 For we brought nothing into \add this\add* world, and we can carry nothing out.
\p
\v 8 But having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
\p
\v 9 But they that are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many foolish and hurtful desires, which plunge men into destruction and perdition.
\p
\v 10 For the love of money is a root of all evils; which some, longing for, have wandered from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
\p
\v 11 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
\p
\v 12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast confessed a good confession before many witnesses.
\p
\v 13 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who giveth life to all things, and Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession;
\p
\v 14 That thou keep \add this\add* commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
\p
\v 15 Which in his own times he shall show, \add who is\add* the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
\p
\v 16 Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, or can see; to whom \add be\add* honour and power everlasting. Amen.
\p
\v 17 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
\p
\v 18 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to share;
\p
\v 19 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the true life.
\p
\v 20 O Timothy, guard the trust; avoiding profane babblings, and oppositions of science, falsely so called;
\p
\v 21 Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace \add be\add* with thee. Amen.

\mt3 The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to
\mt1 Timothy
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
\p
\v 2 To Timothy, \add my\add* beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
\p
\v 3 I thank God, whom I serve from \add my\add* forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;
\p
\v 4 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
\p
\v 5 Calling to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that \add it dwelleth\add* in thee also.
\p
\v 6 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.
\p
\v 7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
\p
\v 8 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;
\p
\v 9 Who hath saved us, and called \add us\add* with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose, and \add the\add* grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
\p
\v 10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel;
\p
\v 11 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
\p
\v 12 For which cause I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to guard sthat which I have committed unto him against that day.
\p
\v 13 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 14 That good thing which was committed unto thee, guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwelleth in us.
\p
\v 15 This thou knowest, that all who are in Asia have turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
\p
\v 16 The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus! for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;
\p
\v 17 But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.
\p
\v 18 The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day! And in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1  ¶ Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 2 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
\p
\v 3 Endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 4 No one going as a soldier entangleth himself with the affairs of life; that he may please him who hath enlisted him as a soldier.
\p
\v 5 And if one strive in the games, he is not crowned if he hath not observed the rules.
\p
\v 6 The husbandman must labour before partaking of the fruits.
\p
\v 7 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
\p
\v 8 Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead, according to my gospel;
\p
\v 9 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil-doer, \add even\add* unto bonds but the word of God is not bound.
\p
\v 10 Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
\p
\v 11 \add It is\add* a faithful saying, For if we have died with \add him,\add* we shall also live with \add him:\add*
\p
\v 12 If we endure, we shall also reign with \add him;\add* if we deny \add him,\add* he also will deny us;
\p
\v 13 If we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.
\p
\v 14 Of these things put \add them\add* in remembrance, charging \add them\add* before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, \add but\add* to the subverting of the hearers.
\p
\v 15 Study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
\p
\v 16 But shun profane \add and\add* vain babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
\p
\v 17 And their word will eat as doth a gangrene; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
\p
\v 18 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.
\p
\v 19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his; and, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
\p
\v 20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
\p
\v 21 If one therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, prepared unto every good work.
\p
\v 22 Flee from youthful lusts; but follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
\p
\v 23 But foolish and unlearned controversies avoid, knowing that they beget strifes.
\p
\v 24 And a servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all, apt in teaching, forbearing,
\p
\v 25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
\p
\v 26 And \add that\add* they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1  ¶ But know this, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
\p
\v 2 For men shall be self-lovers, money-lovers, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
\p
\v 3 Without natural affection, unforgiving, false accusers, incontinent, savage, haters of good,
\p
\v 4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God;
\p
\v 5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; from such turn away.
\p
\v 6 For of this sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with manifold desires,
\p
\v 7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
\p
\v 8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth; men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
\p
\v 9 But they shall proceed no further; for their folly shall be manifest unto all, as theirs also was.
\p
\v 10 But thou hast fully known my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,
\p
\v 11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured; but out of \add them\add* all the Lord delivered me.
\p
\v 12 Yea, and all that will to live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
\p
\v 13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
\p
\v 14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing from whom thou hast learned;
\p 
\v 15 And that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 16 All scripture \add is\add* given by inspiration of God, and \add is\add* profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;

\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ I charge \add thee\add* therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
\p
\v 2 Preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; convince, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and teaching.
\p
\v 3 For the time will come when they will not bear sound teaching; but according to their own desires shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
\p
\v 4 And they shall turn away \add their\add* ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
\p
\v 5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
\p
\v 6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
\p
\v 7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith;
\p
\v 8 Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but also unto all those who have loved his appearing.
\p
\v 9  ¶ Be diligent to come quickly unto me;
\p
\v 10 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and hath gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
\p
\v 11 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee, for he is useful to me for service.
\p
\v 12 But Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
\p
\v 13 The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring \add with thee,\add* and the books, \add but\add* especially the parchments.
\p
\v 14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; the Lord reward him according to his works!
\p
\v 15 Of whom beware thou also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
\p
\v 16 At my first defence no man stood with me, but all forsook me. May it not be laid to their charge!
\p
\v 17 Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me, and strengthened rae; that through me the preaching might be fully known, and all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
\p
\v 18 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve \add me\add* unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom \add be\add* glory for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
\p
\v 20 Erastus abode at Corinth; but Trophimus have I left at Miletus sick.
\p
\v 21 Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness;
\p
\v 2 In hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began;
\p
\v 3 But hath in its own due season manifested his word through the preaching which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
\p
\v 4 To Titus, my true child according to \add our\add* common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.
\p
\v 5 For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldst set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in each city, as I had directed thee;
\p
\v 6 If any is without reproach, the husband of one wife, having believing children not accused of excess, or unruly.
\p
\v 7 For a bishop must be without reproach as God’s steward; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, or to blows; not seeking gain by base means;
\p
\v 8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of the good, sober, just, holy, selfrestrained;
\p
\v 9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound teaching both to exhort and to convict the gainsayers.
\p
\v 10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision;
\p
\v 11 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of base gain.
\p
\v 12 One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.
\p
\v 13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
\p
\v 14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men that turn away from the truth.
\p
\v 15 Unto the pure all things \add are\add* pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving \add is\add* nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled.
\p
\v 16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny \add him,\add* being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ But speak thou the things which become the sound teaching;
\p
\v 2 That aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in the faith, in love, in patience;
\p
\v 3 That aged women, likewise, \add be\add* in behaviour as becometh reverence, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
\p
\v 4 That they may teach the young women to be prudent, to love their husbands, to love their children,
\p
\v 5 \add To be\add* discreet, chaste, diligent at home, good, submitting themselves to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
\p
\v 6 Young men likewise exhort to be sober-minded.
\p
\v 7 In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works: in teaching \add showing\add* uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
\p
\v 8 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.
\p
\v 9 \add Exhort\add* servants to submit themselves to their own masters, \add and\add* to please \add them\add* well in all \add things;\add* not contradicting;
\p
\v 10 Not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the teaching of God our Saviour in all things.
\p
\v 11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
\p
\v 12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and righteously, and godly, in this present world;
\p
\v 13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
\p
\v 14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
\p
\v 15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
\p
\v 2 To speak evil of no one, to be no brawlers, \add but\add* gentle, showing all meekness unto all men.
\p
\v 3 For we ourselves also were at one time foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved bymanifold desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
\p
\v 4 But when the kindness and the love toward man of God our Saviour appeared;
\p
\v 5 Not by works of righteousness which we had done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit;
\p
\v 6 Whom he richly poured forth upon us through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
\p
\v 7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
\p
\v 8 \add This is\add* a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they who have believed God may be diligent to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.
\p
\v 9 But avoid foolish controversies, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
\p
\v 10 A man that is heretical, after the first and second admonition reject;
\p
\v 11 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
\p
\v 12 ¶ When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis; for I have determined to winter there.
\p
\v 13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be lacking with them.
\p
\v 14 And let our own also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.

\mt1 Philemon
\c 1
\cl 
\p
\v 1 ¶ Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy the brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
\p
\v 2 And to Apphia the sister, and to Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
\p
\v 3 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 4 ¶ I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
\p
\v 5 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
\p
\v 6 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual in the acknowledging of every good thing which is in us toward Christ.
\p
\v 7 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the hearts of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
\p
\v 8 Wherefore, though I might have great freedom in Christ to enjoin upon thee that which is seemly,
\p
\v 9 Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 10 I beseech thee for my child, Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds;
\p
\v 11 Who in time past was to thee; unprofitable, but now profitable, to thee and to me;
\p
\v 12 Whom I have sent back to thee; thou therefore receive him, that is, my own heart;
\p
\v 13 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel.
\p
\v 14 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
\p
\v 15 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldst receive him for ever;
\p
\v 16 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord!
\p
\v 17 If thou countest me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
\p
\v 18 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth \add thee\add* aught, put that to my account;
\p
\v 19 I Paul have written \add it\add* with my own hand, I will repay \add it:\add* albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
\p
\v 20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord; refresh my s heart in Christ.
\p
\v 21 ¶ Having confidence in thy obedience I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say.
\p
\v 22 But withal prepare me also a lodging; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
\p
\v 23 ¶ There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
\p
\v 24 Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow labourers.
\p
\v 25 ¶ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with your spirit. Amen.

\mt3 The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the
\mt1 Hebrews
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ God, who in many parts and in many ways spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
\p
\v 2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us in \add his\add* Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
\p
\v 3 Who being the forthshining of \add his\add* glory, and the expression of his being, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high;
\p
\v 4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
\p
\v 5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
\p
\v 6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstborn into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.
\p
\v 7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
\p
\v 8 But unto the Son \add he saith,\add* Thy throne, O God, \add is\add* for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness \add is\add* the sceptre of thy kingdom.
\p
\v 9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
\p
\v 10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thy hands;
\p
\v 11 They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
\p
\v 12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
\p
\v 13 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
\p
\v 14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let \add them\add* slip.
\p
\v 2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;
\p
\v 3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first having begun to be spoken by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard \add him;\add*
\p
\v 4 God also witnessing with them, both by signs and wonders, and by many kinds of miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?
\p
\v 5 ¶ For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
\p
\v 6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
\p
\v 7 Thou madest him for a little time lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands;
\p
\v 8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing \add that is\add* not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
\p
\v 9 But we see Jesus, who was made for a little time lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
\p
\v 10 For it became him, for whom \add are\add* all things, and by whom \add are\add* all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
\p
\v 11 For both he that sanctifieth, and those sanctified \add are\add* all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
\p
\v 12 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I sing praise unto thee.
\p
\v 13 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children whom God hath given me.
\p
\v 14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might bring to naught him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
\p
\v 15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
\p
\v 16 For verily not of angels did he take hold, but he took hold of the seed of Abraham.
\p
\v 17 Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto \add his\add* brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things toward God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
\p
\v 18 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus;
\p
\v 2 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all \add God’s\add* house.
\p
\v 3 For he was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath built the house hath more honour than the house.
\p
\v 4 For every house is built by some \add man;\add* but he that built all things \add is\add* God.
\p
\v 5 And Moses verily \add was\add* faithful in all \add God’s\add* house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken afterward;
\p
\v 6 But Christ as a Son over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
\p
\v 7 Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,
\p
\v 8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness,
\p
\v 9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
\p
\v 10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in \add their\add* heart, and they have not known my ways.
\p
\v 11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.
\p
\v 12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
\p
\v 13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
\p
\v 14 For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
\p
\v 15 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
\p
\v 16 For did not some, when they had heard, provoke? nay, did not all that came out of Egypt with Moses?
\p
\v 17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? \add was\add* it not with them that had sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
\p
\v 18 And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?
\p
\v 19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise still remaining of entering into his rest, any of you should be found to have come short of it.
\p
\v 2 For we have had good news preached unto us, as well as they; but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard.
\p
\v 3 For we who have believed do enter into the rest, as he hath said, As I have sworn in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
\p
\v 4 For he hath spoken in a certain place of the seventh \add day\add* thus, And God rested the seventh day from all his works.
\p
\v 5 And again in this manner They shall not enter into my rest.
\p
\v 6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom the good news was first preached entered not in because of unbelief;
\p
\v 7 Again,he indicateth a certain day, saying in David, To day — after so long a time, as had already been said— To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
\p
\v 8 For if Joshua had brought them into the rest, then he would not afterward have spoken of another day.
\p
\v 9 So then there still remaineth a rest for the people of God.
\p
\v 10 For he that hath entered into his rest, himself also hath rested from his own works, as God \add did\add* from his.
\p
\v 11 Let us be diligent therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
\p
\v 12 For the word of God is living, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and judgeth the thoughts and reasonings of the heart.
\p
\v 13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things \add are\add* naked and laid bare unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
\p
\v 14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast \add our\add* confession.
\p
\v 15 For we have not a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, \add yet\add* without sin.
\p
\v 16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace for help in time of need.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶  Now every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men in things Godward, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;
\p
\v 2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; since he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
\p
\v 3 And for this reason he is obliged, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
\p
\v 4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as \add was\add* Aaron.
\p
\v 5 Thus Christ also hath not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he \add was appointed by him\add* that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.
\p
\v 6 As he saith also in another \add place,\add* Thou \add art\add* a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
\p
\v 7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard as to that which he feared;
\p
\v 8 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
\p
\v 9 And having been perfected, he became the Author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;
\p
\v 10 Called of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Of whom we have many things to say, but hard to be explained, seeing ye are dull of hearing.
\p
\v 12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again what are the first principles of the oracles of God; and have become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food.
\p
\v 13 For every one whose food is milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness; for he is a babe.
\p
\v 14 But solid food is for the fullgrown, who by use have their senses trained to distinguish between good and evil.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ Therefore leaving the first principles of the teaching of Christ, let us go on unto full growth; not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
\p
\v 2 Of the teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
\p
\v 3 And this will we do, if God permit.
\p
\v 4 For \add it is\add* impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
\p
\v 5 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
\p
\v 6 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put \add him\add* to an open shame.
\p
\v 7 For the ground which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth vegetation useful for them for whom it is cultivated, receiveth blessing from God;
\p
\v 8 But that which beareth thorns and briers \add is\add* rejected, and \add is\add* nigh unto cursing; whose end \add is\add* to be burned.
\p
\v 9 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
\p
\v 10 For God \add is\add* not unrighteous, to forget your work and the love which ye have shown toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
\p
\v 11 And we long that each one of you may show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end;
\p
\v 12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
\p
\v 13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,
\p
\v 14 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
\p
\v 15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
\p
\v 16 For men swear by a greater; and the oath for confirmation \add is\add* to them an end of all controversy.
\p
\v 17 Wherefore God, wishing to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, intervened with an oath;
\p
\v 18 That by two immutable things, in which \add it was\add* impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us;
\p
\v 19 Which \add hope\add* we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the vail;
\p
\v 20 Whither the forerunner hath for us entered, \add even\add* Jesus, made a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
\c 7
\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 ¶ For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
\p
\v 2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; being first by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
\p
\v 3 Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but likened to the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
\p
\v 4 Now consider how great this man \add was,\add* unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
\p
\v 5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham;
\p
\v 6 But he who had no genealogy from them received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
\p
\v 7 And beyond all contradiction the less is blessed by the better.
\p
\v 8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he \add receiveth them,\add* of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
\p
\v 9 And, so to speak, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes in Abraham;
\p
\v 10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.
\p
\v 11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need \add was there\add* that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be named after the order of Aaron?
\p
\v 12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
\p
\v 13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man hath been attached to the service of the altar.
\p
\v 14 For \add it is\add* clear that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
\p
\v 15 And this is yet far more evident, since after the similitude of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,
\p
\v 16 Who is made, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of endless life.
\p
\v 17 For he testifieth, Thou \add art\add* a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
\p
\v 18 Thus there is a setting aside of the commandment going before, for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
\p
\v 19 For the law perfected nothing, but it was the bringing in of a better hope; by which we draw nigh unto God.
\p
\v 20 And inasmuch as not without an oath \add he was made priest:\add* —
\p
\v 21 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sweareth and will not repent, Thou \add art\add* a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek:) —
\p
\v 23 By so much Jesus became the surety of a better covenant.
\p
\v 23 And they indeed have been many priests, because they were not suffered to continue, by reason of death; 
\p
\v 24 But he, because he abideth for ever, hath an 2unchangeable priesthood.
\p
\v 25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost who come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
\p
\v 26 For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
\p
\v 27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s; for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.
\p
\v 28 And the law maketh men high priests who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, \add maketh\add* the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
\c 8
\cl CHAPTER 8
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now of the things which we have spoken \add this is\add* the sum: We have such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
\p
\v 2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
\p
\v 3 And as every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices, therefore it is needful that this one also have something to offer.
\p
\v 4 Now if he were on earth, he should not even be a priest, since there are \add already\add* priests that offer gifts according to the law;
\p
\v 5 Who serve in the representation and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, \add that\add* thou make all things according to the pattern shown to thee in the mount.
\p
\v 6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the Mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
\p
\v 7 For if that first \add covenant\add* had been faultless, no place would have then been sought for the second.
\p
\v 8 For finding fault, he saith to them, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
\p
\v 9 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 10 For this \add is\add* the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws into their mind, and write them on their heart; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people;
\p
\v 11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them.
\p
\v 12 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
\p
\v 13 In that he saith, A new \add covenant,\add* he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old \add is\add* ready to vanish away.
\c 9
\cl CHAPTER 9
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then verily the first \add covenant\add* had also ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.
\p
\v 2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein \add was\add* the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the Holy place.
\p
\v 3 And after the second vail, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies;
\p
\v 4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein \add was\add* the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
\p
\v 5 And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak in detail.
\p
\v 6 Now when these things were thus arranged, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services.
\p
\v 7 But into the second \add went\add* the high priest alone, once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and \add for\add* the errors of the people;
\p
\v 8 The Holy Spirit signifying this, that the way into the holy place was not yet made manifest, while the first tabernacle was yet standing;
\p
\v 9 Which \add was\add* a figure for the present time, in accordance with which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not perfect him that worshipped, as pertaining to the conscience;
\p
\v 10 \add Consisting\add* only of meats and drinks, and various washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.
\p
\v 11 But Christ having come as a high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;
\p
\v 12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained an eternal redemption.
\p
\v 13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh;
\p
\v 14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to worship the living God?
\p
\v 15 And for this cause he is the Mediator of a new covenant, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
\p
\v 16 For where a testament \add is,\add* there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.
\p
\v 17 For a testament \add is\add* of force after men are dead; otherwise it is of no strength at all, while the testator liveth.
\p
\v 18 Whereupon neither was the first covenant inaugurated without blood.
\p
\v 19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,
\p
\v 20 Saying, This \add is\add* the blood of the covenant which God hath enjoined unto you.
\p
\v 21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the service.
\p
\v 22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
\p
\v 23 \add It was\add* therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
\p
\v 24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;
\p
\v 25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with other blood than his own;
\p
\v 26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world; but now once, in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
\p
\v 27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this, judgment;
\p
\v 28 So also Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time, apart from sin, unto salvation.
\c 10
\cl CHAPTER 10
\p
\v 1 ¶ For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices, which they offered year by year continually, perfect those who present themselves.
\p
\v 2 For then, would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshippers, once purged, would have had no more conscience of sins.
\p
\v 3 But in those \add sacrifices there is\add* a calling to mind of sins every year.
\p
\v 4 For \add it is\add* not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
\p
\v 5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou desirest not, but a body hast thou prepared me;
\p
\v 6 In burnt offerings and sin offerings thou hast had no pleasure.
\p
\v 7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
\p
\v 8 Above, saying, Sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings thou desirest not, neither hadst pleasure therein — which are offered by the law —
\p
\v 9 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
\p
\v 10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once \add for all.\add* 
\p
\v 11 And every priest standeth daily ministering, and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;
\p
\v 12 But he, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down at the right hand of God;
\p
\v 13 From henceforth expecting, till his enemies be made his footstool.
\p
\v 14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
\p
\v 15 And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness; for after he had said,
\p
\v 16 This \add is\add* the covenant that I will covenant with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
\p
\v 17 \add He saith\add* also, Their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
\p
\v 18 Now where remission of these \add is, there is\add* no longer a sin offering.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
\p
\v 20 A new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the vail, that is to say, his flesh;
\p
\v 21 And \add having\add* a high priest over the house of God;
\p
\v 22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
\p
\v 23 Let us hold fast the confession of the hope without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)
\p
\v 24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works;
\p
\v 25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some \add is;\add* but encouraging \add one another:\add* and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
\p
\v 26 For if we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no longer a sin-offering,
\p
\v 27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
\p
\v 28 He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses;
\p
\v 29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, a common thing, and hath insulted the Spirit of grace?
\p
\v 30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance \add belongeth\add* unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
\p
\v 31 \add It is\add* a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
\p
\v 32 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great struggle with sufferings;
\p
\v 33 On the one hand, when ye were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions; and on the other, when ye became companions of them that were so used.
\p
\v 34 For ye sympathized with those in prison, and took joyfully the spoiling of your possessions, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring possession.
\p
\v 35 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.
\p
\v 36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
\p
\v 37 For yet a little while, and the Coming One will come, and will not tarry.
\p
\v 38 Now the just shall live by faith; but if \add any man\add* draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
\p
\v 39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that have faith to the saving of the soul.
\c 11
\cl CHAPTER 11
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
\p
\v 2 For by it the men of old obtained a good testimony.
\p
\v 3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were planned by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
\p
\v 4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and by it he, being dead, yet speaketh.
\p
\v 5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had this testimony, that he had pleased God.
\p
\v 6 But without faith \add it is\add* impossible to please \add him;\add* for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and \add that\add* he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
\p
\v 7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
\p
\v 8 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should afterward receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
\p
\v 9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as \add in\add* a strange country, living in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise;
\p
\v 10 For he waited for the city which hath the foundations, whose architect and builder \add is\add* God.
\p
\v 11 Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
\p
\v 12 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, \add so many\add* as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore, innumerable.
\p
\v 13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of \add them,\add* and embraced \add them,\add* and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
\p
\v 14 For they that say such things show plainly that they are seeking a country.
\p
\v 15 Now, truly, if these had in mind that country from which they had come out, they might have had opportunity to return;
\p
\v 16 But indeed they desired a better, that is, a heavenly country; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.
\p
\v 17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac; and he that had received the promises, offered up his only begotten,
\p
\v 18 As to whom it had been said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:
\p
\v 19 Accounting that God \add was\add* able to raise \add him\add* up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.
\p
\v 20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
\p
\v 21 By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, \add leaning\add* upon the top of his staff.
\p
\v 22 By faith Joseph, when dying, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
\p
\v 23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.
\p
\v 24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;
\p
\v 25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
\p
\v 26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked away to the recompence.
\p
\v 27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
\p
\v 28 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
\p
\v 29 By faith they passed through the Red Sea as through dry land; which the Egyptians attempting to do, were drowned.
\p
\v 30 ¶ By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.
\p
\v 31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with the unbelieving, having received the spies with peace.
\p
\v 32 ¶ And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah; David also, and Samuel, and the prophets;
\p
\v 33 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
\p
\v 34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
\p
\v 35 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection;
\p
\v 36 And others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment.
\p
\v 37 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
\p
\v 38 (Of whom the world was not worthy); they wandered in deserts, and mountains, and dens and caves of the earth.
\p
\v 39 And these all, having obtained a good testimony through faith, received not the promise:
\p
\v 40 God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
\c 12
\cl CHAPTER 12
\p
\v 1 ¶ Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
\p
\v 2 Looking unto Jesus the Author and finisher of faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
\p
\v 3 For consider him that endured such opposition of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your souls.
\p
\v 4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
\p
\v 5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto sons, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him;
\p
\v 6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
\p
\v 7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
\p
\v 8 But if ye be without chastening, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
\p
\v 9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected \add us,\add* and we gave \add them\add* reverence; shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
\p
\v 10 For they verily for a few days chastened \add us\add* as seemed right to them; but he for \add our\add* profit, that \add we\add* might be partakers of his holiness.
\p
\v 11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous; nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them that are exercised thereby.
\p
\v 12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;
\p
\v 13 And make straight paths for your feet, that the lame be not turned out of the way, but rather healed.
\p
\v 14 Follow peace with all, and the holiness without which no man shall see the Lord; 
\p
\v 15 Watching lest there be any one who lacks the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble \add you,\add* and thereby many be defiled;
\p
\v 16 Lest there \add be\add* any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.
\p
\v 17 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected— for he found no place of repentance— though he sought it carefully with tears.
\p
\v 18 But ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
\p
\v 19 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which \add voice\add* they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more,—
\p
\v 20 For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;
\p
\v 21 And so terrible was the sight, \add that\add* Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake;—
\p
\v 22 But ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
\p
\v 23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, who are registered in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men, perfected,
\p
\v 24 And to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than \add that of\add* Abel.
\p
\v 25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more \add shall not\add* we \add escape,\add* if we turn away from him that \add speaketh\add* from heaven;
\p
\v 26 Whose voice then shook the earth; but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also the heaven.
\p
\v 27 And this \add word,\add* Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
\p
\v 28 Wherefore we, receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear;
\p
\v 29 For our God \add is\add* a consuming fire.
\c 13
\cl CHAPTER 13
\p
\v 1 ¶ Let brotherly love continue.
\p
\v 2 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers; for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
\p
\v 3 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; \add and\add* those who are in adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.
\p
\v 4 Marriage \add is\add* to be honoured by all, and the bed undefiled: but fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
\p
\v 5 Let your manner of life be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have; for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
\p
\v 6 So that we may boldly say, The Lord \add is\add* my helper, and I will not fear; what can man do unto me?
\p
\v 7 ¶ Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of \add their\add* conversation.
\p
\v 8 Jesus Christ \add is\add* the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
\p
\v 9 Be not carried about with manifold and strange teachings. For \add it is\add* good that the heart be established by grace; not by meats which did not profit those who walked therein.
\p
\v 10 We have an altar, from which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle.
\p
\v 11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holy places by the high priest as a sin offering, are burned outside the camp.
\p
\v 12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered outside the gate.
\p
\v 13 Let us go forth therefore unto him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.
\p
\v 14 For here have we no abiding city, but we seek the coming one.
\p
\v 15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of \add our\add* lips, giving thanks to his name.
\p
\v 16 But to do good, and to share what you have with others, forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
\p
\v 17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves; for they watch over your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that \add is\add* unprofitable for you.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Pray for us; for we trust we have a good conscience, purposing to conduct ourselves sincerely in all things.
\p
\v 19 But I beseech \add you\add* the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
\p
\v 20 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
\p
\v 21 Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom \add be\add* glory for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 22 And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation; for it is but in few words that I have written to you.
\p
\v 23 Know ye that \add our\add* brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
\p
\v 24 ¶ Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
\p
\v 25 ¶ Grace \add be\add* with you all. Amen.

\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
\p
\v 2 ¶ My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
\p
\v 3 Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
\p
\v 4 But let patience have its perfect work, that ye may be mature and complete, lacking in nothing.
\p
\v 5 If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
\p
\v 6 But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting. For he that doubteth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
\p
\v 7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord, —
\p
\v 8 A double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
\p
\v 9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted;
\p
\v 10 But the rich, in that he is made low; because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
\p
\v 11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
\p
\v 12 Blessed \add is\add* the man that endureth temptation; for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
\p
\v 13 Let no one say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any one;
\p
\v 14 But each one is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own desire, and enticed.
\p
\v 15 Then when desire hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
\p
\v 16 Be not led astray, my beloved brethren.
\p
\v 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
\p
\v 18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;
\p
\v 20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
\p
\v 21 Wherefore put away all filthiness and overflow of evil, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
\p
\v 22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
\p
\v 23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror;
\p
\v 24 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
\p
\v 25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of \add the\add* work, this man shall be blessed in his doing.
\p
\v 26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion \add is\add* vain.
\p
\v 27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, \add and\add* to keep himself unspotted from the world.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, \add the Lord\add* of glory, with respect of persons.
\p
\v 2 For if there come unto your synagogue a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
\p
\v 3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the fine clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here by my footstool;
\p
\v 4 Are ye not then partial in ourselves, and are become evil-thinking judges?
\p
\v 5 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
\p
\v 6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you? and they drag you before the judgment seats.
\p
\v 7 Do not they blaspheme the worthy name by which ye are called?
\p
\v 8 If, however, ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well;
\p
\v 9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors. 
\p
\v 10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one \add point,\add* he is guilty of all.
\p
\v 11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou hast become a transgressor of the law.
\p
\v 12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
\p
\v 13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shown no mercy. Mercy glorieth over judgment.
\p
\v 14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can \add such\add* faith save him?
\p
\v 15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
\p
\v 16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?
\p
\v 17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
\p
\v 18 Also, one may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.
\p
\v 19 Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.
\p
\v 20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
\p
\v 21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
\p
\v 22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works faith was perfected?
\p
\v 23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.
\p
\v 24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith alone.
\p
\v 25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent \add them\add* out another way?
\p
\v 26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ My brethren, be not many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the severer judgment.
\p
\v 2 For in many things we all stumble. If any one stumbleth not in word, this is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.
\p
\v 3 Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
\p
\v 4 Behold also the ships, which though so great, and driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about by a very small rudder, whithersoever the helmsman wisheth.
\p
\v 5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a forest a little fire kindleth!
\p
\v 6 And the tongue \add is\add* a fire, a world of iniquity; so is the tongue among our members, the defiler of the whole body; which setteth on fire the course of nature; and is set on fire by hell.
\p
\v 7 For every kind of beasts, and of , birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind;
\p
\v 8 But the tongue can no man tame; an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
\p
\v 9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after God’s likeness.
\p
\v 10 Out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
\p
\v 11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet \add water\add* and bitter?
\p
\v 12 Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives? or a vine, figs? Neither can salt water produce sweet.
\p
\v 13 Who is wise and intelligent among you? Let him show out of a good conduct his works in the meekness of wisdom.
\p
\v 14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
\p
\v 15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but \add is\add* earthly, sensual, devilish.
\p
\v 16 For where envying and strife are, there \add is\add* confusion, and every evil work.
\p
\v 17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easily persuaded, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
\p
\v 18 And the fruit of righteousness, with peace, is sown by them that cultivate peace.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶  Whence \add come\add* wars and fightings among you? \add come they\add* not hence, \add even\add* of your pleasures, which wage war among your members?
\p
\v 2 Ye desire, and have not; ye kill, and envy, and cannot obtain; ye fight and war. Ye have not, because ye ask not.
\p
\v 3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask basely, that ye may spend it in your pleasures.
\p
\v 4 Adulteresses! Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity against God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
\p
\v 5 Do ye think that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the Spirit that dwelleth in us desire enviously?
\p
\v 6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
\p
\v 7 Submit yourselves therefore to God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
\p
\v 8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse \add your\add* hands, \add ye\add* sinners; and purify \add your\add* hearts, \add ye\add* double-minded.
\p
\v 9 Sorrow, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning, and \add your\add* joy to heaviness.
\p
\v 10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
\p
\v 11 Speak not against one another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law; but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
\p
\v 12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest another?
\p
\v 13 ¶ Come now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain;
\p
\v 14 Whereas ye know not what \add shall be\add* on the morrow. For what \add is\add* your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
\p
\v 15 Ye ought rather to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
\p
\v 16 But now ye rejoice in your boastings; all such rejoicing is evil.
\p
\v 17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth \add it\add* not, to him it is sin.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ Come now, ye rich, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon \add you.\add*
\p
\v 2 Your wealth has become corruption, and your garments motheaten.
\p
\v 3 Your gold and silver are rusted; and their rust shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have heaped up treasure together in the last days.
\p
\v 4 Behold, the wages of the labourers who have reaped your fields, which is of you kept back unjustly, crieth; and the cries of those that have reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts.
\p
\v 5 Ye have lived in luxury upon the earth, and been wanton; ye have pampered your hearts in a day of slaughter.
\p
\v 6 Ye have condemned, ye have killed the righteous; he doth not resist you.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until it receiveth the early and latter rain.
\p
\v 8 Be ye also patient; establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
\p
\v 9 Complain not one against another, brethren, lest ye be judged: behold, the judge standeth before the door.
\p
\v 10 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering, and of patience.
\p
\v 11 Behold, we count them happy who have endured. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
\p
\v 12 But above all things, my brethren, swear not; neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall under judgment.
\p
\v 13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing.
\p
\v 14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;
\p
\v 15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
\p
\v 16 Confess, therefore, your faults to one another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
\p
\v 17 Elijah was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not upon the earth for three years and six months.
\p
\v 18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit.
\p
\v 19 Brethren, if any among you err concerning the truth, and one convert him;
\p
\v 20 Let him know, that he that turneth a sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.

\mt1 Peter
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
\p
\v 2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
\p
\v 3 Blessed \add be\add* the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
\p
\v 4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,
\p
\v 5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
\p
\v 6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold trials;
\p
\v 7 That the testing of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that is perishable yet is tested by fire, may be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ;
\p
\v 8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see \add him \add* not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory;
\p
\v 9 Receiving the end of your faith, \add even\add* the salvation of \add your\add* souls.
\p
\v 10 Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace \add that should come\add* unto you:
\p
\v 11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ who was in them did signify, when he testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow;
\p
\v 12 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.
\p
\v 13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
\p
\v 14 As obedient children, not conforming yourselves according to the former desires in your ignorance;
\p
\v 15 But as he who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of life;
\p
\v 16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.
\p
\v 17 And if ye call him Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear;
\p
\v 18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things, \add as\add* silver and gold, from your vain manner of life, handed down from your fathers;
\p
\v 19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot;
\p
\v 20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in these last times for you,
\p
\v 21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.
\p
\v 22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned brotherly love, love one another out of a pure heart fervently;
\p
\v 23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.
\p
\v 24 For all flesh \add is\add* as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth;
\p
\v 25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
\p
\v 2 As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that by it ye may grow unto salvation,
\p
\v 3 If indeed ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
\p
\v 4 To whom coming, \add as unto\add* a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but chosen of God, precious,
\p
\v 5 Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious; and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.
\p
\v 7 Unto you therefore who believe \add he is\add* precious: but unto them that disbelieve, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner,
\p
\v 8 And, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, \add even to them\add* that stumble at the word, being disobedient; whereunto also they were appointed.
\p
\v 9 But ye \add are\add* a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
\p
\v 10 Who once were not a people, but now are the people of God; who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Dearly beloved, I beseech \add you\add* as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly desires, which war against the soul;
\p
\v 12 Having your conduct becoming among the Gentiles; that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by \add your\add* good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
\p
\v 14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
\p
\v 15 For so is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men;
\p
\v 16 As free, and not using \add your\add* liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as God’s servants.
\p
\v 17 Show honour to all: love the brotherhood; fear God; honoiw the king.
\p
\v 18 Servants, \add be\add* subject to \add your\add* masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the perverse.
\p
\v 19 For this \add is\add* acceptable, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
\p
\v 20 For what glory \add is it,\add* if, when ye are buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer \add for it,\add* ye take it patiently, this \add is\add* acceptable with God.
\p
\v 21 ¶ For even hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps;
\p
\v 22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth;
\p
\v 23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed \add all\add* to him that judgeth righteously;
\p
\v 24 Who himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.
\p
\v 25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶  Likewise, ye wives, \add be\add* subject to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may, without the word, be won by the manner of life of their wives;
\p
\v 2 While they behold your pure conduct in fear.
\p
\v 3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward one of braiding the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on apparel;
\p
\v 4 But the hidden man of the heart, in that which is imperishable, even of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price.
\p
\v 5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands;
\p
\v 6 Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye have become, and, by well-doing your fear is without terror.
\p
\v 7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with \add them\add* according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.
\p
\v 8 ¶ Finally, \add be ye\add* all of one mind, having compassion one with another, love as brethren, \add be\add* pitiful, \add be\add* courteous:
\p
\v 9 Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing; but, on the contrary, blessing; because ye have been hereunto called, that ye should inherit blessing.
\p
\v 10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile;
\p
\v 11 Let him avoid evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it.
\p
\v 12 For the eyes of the Lord \add are\add* over the righteous, and his ears \add are open\add* unto their prayers; but the face of the Lord \add is\add* against them that do evil.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And who \add is\add* he that will harm you, if ye become followers of that which is good?
\p
\v 14 But even if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy \add are ye:\add* and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
\p
\v 15 But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts; and \add be\add* ready always to \add give\add* an answer to every one that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;
\p
\v 16 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conduct in Christ.
\p
\v 17 For \add it is\add* better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing.
\p
\v 18 ¶ For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit;
\p
\v 19 Wherein he also went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
\p
\v 20 Who were disobedient in the old time, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved through water;
\p
\v 21 Which also, after a true type, now saveth you, even baptism, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the seeking of a good conscience after God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ;
\p
\v 22 Who is gone into heaven, and is at the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
\p
\v 2 So as no longer to live the rest of the time in the flesh by men’s desires, but by the will of God.
\p
\v 3 For the time past may suffice to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries;
\p
\v 4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with \add them\add* to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of \add you:\add* 
\p
\v 5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and dead.
\p
\v 6 For to this end was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged, as regards men, after the flesh, but live, as regards God, after the Spirit.
\p
\v 7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and be watchful unto prayers.
\p
\v 8 And above all things have fervent love among yourselves; for love covereth a multitude of sins.
\p
\v 9 Use hospitality one to another without murmuring.
\p
\v 10 According as each hath received a gift, minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;
\p
\v 11 If any one speaketh, as uttering God’s oracles; if any one serveth, as of the ability which God giveth; that God in all things may be glorified, through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial taking place among you to prove you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:
\p
\v 13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.
\p
\v 14 If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy \add are ye;\add* for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
\p
\v 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or \add as\add* a thief, or \add as\add* an evildoer, or as a busy-body in other men’s matters;
\p
\v 16 But if \add any one suffer\add* as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this Name.
\p
\v 17 For the time \add is come\add* that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if \add it\add* first \add begin\add* at us, what shall the end \add be\add* of them that obey not the gospel of God?
\p
\v 18 And if the righteous is saved with difficulty, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?
\p
\v 19 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ The elders among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory about to be revealed:
\p
\v 2 Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight, not by constraint, but willingly; not for base gain, but of a ready mind;
\p
\v 3 Neither as lording it over your portions, but being examples to the flock.
\p
\v 4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory.
\p
\v 5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder; and all of you be clothed with humility toward one another; for, God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
\p
\v 6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;
\p
\v 7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
\p
\v 8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour;
\p
\v 9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
\p
\v 10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory in Christ, after ye have suffered a little while, himself shall make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle \add you.\add*
\p
\v 11 To him \add be\add* glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Through Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I consider, I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
\p
\v 13 She that is in Babylon, elect together with \add you,\add* saluteth you; and Mark, my son.
\p
\v 14 Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

\mt3 The Second Epistle General of
\mt1 Peter
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:
\p
\v 2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
\p
\v 3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us by his own glory and virtue;
\p
\v 4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
\p
\v 5 And for this very reason, using therewith all diligence, in your faith have also virtue; in virtue, knowledge;
\p
\v 6 In knowledge, self-control; in self-control, patience; in patience, godliness;
\p
\v 7 In godliness, brotherly kindness; in brotherly kindness, love.
\p
\v 8 For if these things be in yon, and abound, they make \add you\add* to be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
\p
\v 10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, use diligence to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall;
\p
\v 11 For so shall be ministered unto you richly an entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the present truth.
\p
\v 13 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting \add you\add* in remembrance;
\p
\v 14 Knowing that shortly I must put off \add this\add* my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shown me.
\p
\v 15 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my departure to have these things always in remembrance.
\p
\v 16 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his majesty.
\p
\v 17 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the resplendent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
\p
\v 18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.
\p
\v 19 ¶ We have also the prophetic word made sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed in your hearts, as unto a lamp that shineth in a dark place till the day dawn and the day-star arise.
\p
\v 20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of its own interpretation.
\p
\v 21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ But there arose false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
\p
\v 2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
\p
\v 3 And through covetousness shall they with well-turned words make merchandise of you; for whom the judgment from of old lingereth not, and their condemnation slumbereth not.
\p
\v 4 For if God spared not angels that sinned, but cast \add them\add* down to hell, and delivered \add them\add* into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
\p
\v 5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah, one of eight, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
\p
\v 6 And burning the cities of Sodom and Gromorrah into ashes condemned \add them\add* with an overthrow, making \add them\add* an example unto those that afterward should live ungodly;
\p
\v 7 And delivered righteous Lot, distressed with the filthy manner of life of they wicked;
\p
\v 8 (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed \add his\add* righteous soul from day to day with \add their\add* unlawful deeds;)
\p
\v 9 ¶ The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unrighteous unto the day of judgment to be punished;
\p
\v 10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in unclean desire, and despise authority. Presumptuous, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries.
\p
\v 11 Whereas angels, being greater in power and might, bring not a railing accusation against them before the Lord.
\p
\v 12 But these, like brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall, in their destroying, be themselves destroyed;
\p
\v 13 And shall receive in unrighteousness the wages of unrighteousness. \add These are\add* they that count it pleasure to riot in the day-time; spots, and blemishes; sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
\p
\v 14 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls; a heart they have, trained in covetous practices. Cursed children!
\p
\v 15 Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, following the way of Balaam \add the son\add* of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,
\p
\v 16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s voice forbade the madness of the prophet.
\p
\v 17 ¶ These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; for whom the mist of darkness is reserved.
\p
\v 18 For when they speak great swelling \add words\add* of vanity, they allure through the desires of the flesh, \add through much\add* wantonness, those that were just escaping from them who live in error.
\p
\v 19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption: for by whom a man is overcome, by him is he also brought into slavery.
\p
\v 20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, their latter condition is worse than the former.
\p
\v 21 For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
\p
\v 22 But it hath happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog \add is\add* turned to its own vomit again; and the sow that had washed, to wallowing in the mire.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere minds by way of remembrance;
\p
\v 2 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour;
\p 
\v 3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers with their scoffing, walking after their own desires,
\p
\v 4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as from the beginning of the creation.
\p
\v 5 For this they wilfully ignore, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and by means of water;
\p
\v 6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished;
\p
\v 7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
\p
\v 8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day \add is \add* with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
\p
\v 9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some count slackness; but is longsuffering toward us, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
\p
\v 10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
\p
\v 11 ¶ \add Seeing\add* then \add that\add* all these things shall be dissolved, what ought ye to be in holy conduct and godliness,
\p
\v 12 Looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
\p
\v 13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
\p
\v 14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
\p
\v 15 And account \add that\add* the longsuffering of our Lord \add is \add* salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given unto him, hath written unto you;
\p
\v 16 As also in all \add his\add* epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as \add they do\add* also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
\p
\v 17 Ye therefore, beloved, knowing \add these\add* things beforehand, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.
\p
\v 18 But grow in grace, and \add in\add* the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him \add be\add* glory both now and for ever. Amen.

\mt1 John
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;
\p
\v 2 For the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;'
\p
\v 3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship \add is\add* with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
\p
\v 5 ¶ This then is the message which we have heard from him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
\p
\v 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
\p
\v 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
\p
\v 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
\p
\v 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us \add our \add* sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
\p
\v 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
\p
\v 2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
\p
\v 3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
\p
\v 4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;
\p
\v 5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected; hereby know we that we are in him.
\p
\v 6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
\p
\v 7 Beloved, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.
\p
\v 8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing, and the true light is now shining.
\p
\v 9 ¶ He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.
\p
\v 10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.
\p
\v 11 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.
\p
\v 12 ¶ I write unto you, my little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name’s sake.
\p
\v 13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.
\p
\v 14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him who is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the evil one.
\p
\v 15 ¶ Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
\p
\v 16 For all that \add is\add* in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
\p
\v 17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Little children, it is the last time; and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.
\p
\v 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but \add they went out\add* that they might be made manifest; because not all are of us.
\p
\v 20 But ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
\p
\v 21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
\p
\v 22 Who is the liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is the antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.
\p
\v 23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father; he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.
\p
\v 24 As for you, let that abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall abide in you, ye also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father.
\p
\v 25 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, \add even\add* eternal life.
\p
\v 26 ¶ These \add things\add* have I written unto you concerning them that deceive you.
\p
\v 27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you; but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.
\p
\v 28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
\p
\v 29 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and such we are. Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
\p
\v 2 Beloved, now are we children of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.
\p
\v 3 And every one that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
\p
\v 4 ¶ Whosoever committeth sin committeth also lawlessness; yea, sin is lawlessness.
\p
\v 5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
\p
\v 6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him or known him.
\p
\v 7 Little children, let no one deceive you; he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
\p
\v 8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
\p
\v 9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
\p
\v 10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
\p
\v 11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
\p
\v 12 Not as Cain, \add who\add* was of that evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.
\p
\v 13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
\p
\v 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not \add his\add* brother abideth in death.
\p
\v 15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer; and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
\p
\v 16 Hereby we have known love; because he hath laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down \add our\add* lives for the brethren.
\p
\v 17 But whoso hath this world’s goods, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his heart against him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
\p
\v 18 My little children, let us not love with word, nor with tongue \add only;\add* but in deed and in truth.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
\p
\v 20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
\p
\v 21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, \add then\add* have we confidence toward God.
\p
\v 22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
\p
\v 23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
\p
\v 24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit, whom he hath given us.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
\p
\v 2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus is \add the\add* Christ, come in flesh, is of God;
\p
\v 3 And every spirit that confesseth not Jesus is not from God: and this is that \add spirit\add* of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already it is in the world.
\p
\v 4 Ye are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
\p
\v 5 They are of the world; therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.
\p
\v 6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the Spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
\p
\v 8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
\p
\v 9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
\p
\v 10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son \add to be\add* the propitiation for our sins.
\p
\v 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
\p
\v 12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
\p
\v 13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
\p
\v 14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son \add to be \add* the Saviour of the world.
\p
\v 15 ¶ Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
\p
\v 16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
\p
\v 17 Herein hath love been perfected with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, so are we in this world.
\p
\v 18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not perfected in love.
\p
\v 19 We love, because he first loved us.
\p
\v 20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen.
\p
\v 21 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
\p
\v 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
\p
\v 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
\p
\v 4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, \add even\add* our faith.
\p
\v 5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
\p
\v 6 This is he that came by water and blood, \add even\add* Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood.
\p
\v 7 And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is the truth.
\p
\v 8 There are three that bear witness: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.
\p
\v 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; because this is the witness of God, which he hath testified of his Son.
\p
\v 10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself; he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the witness that God gave of his Son.
\p
\v 11 And this is the witness: that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
\p
\v 12 He that hath the Son hath the life; \add and\add* he that hath not the Son of God hath not the life.
\p
\v 13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, who believe on the name of the Son of God.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us;
\p
\v 15 And if we know that he heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of him.
\p
\v 16 If any one seeth his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray concerning it.
\p
\v 17 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
\p
\v 18 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and the evil one toucheth him not.
\p
\v 19 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the evil one.
\p
\v 20 \add And\add* we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, \add even\add* in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
\p
\v 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.

\p
\v 2 For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.
\p
\v 3 Grace, mercy, peace, shall be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
\p
\v 4 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
\p
\v 5 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
\p
\v 6 And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, that, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.
\p
\v 7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.

\v 2 Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
\p
\v 3 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
\p
\v 4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth.
\p
\v 5 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, even when strangers;
\p
\v 6 Who have testified of thy love before the church; whom if thou bring forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, thou shalt do well;
\p
\v 7 Because for the Name have they gone forth, taking nothing from the Gentiles.
\p
\v 8 We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.
\p
\v 9 I wrote unto the church; but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not.
\p
\v 10 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words; and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, but forbiddeth them that would, and casteth \add them\add* out of the church.
\p
\v 11 Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God; but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
\p
\v 12 Demetrius hath witness borne to him by all, and by the truth itself: yea, and we \add also\add* bear witness; and ye know that our witness is true.
\p
\v 13 I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:
\p
\v 14 But I hope I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace to thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.

\mt3 The General Epistle of
\mt1 Jude
\c 1
\cl 
\p
\v 1 ¶ Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are called, beloved in God the Father, \add and\add* kept for Jesus Christ:
\p
\v 2 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
\p
\v 3 Beloved, exercising all diligence to write unto you of our common salvation, I have been constrained to write unto you, and exhort \add you\add* that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints.
\p
\v 4 For there are certain men crept in secretly, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying our only Master, and Lord, Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
\p
\v 6 And the angels which kept not their first state, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
\p
\v 7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the judgment of eternal fire.
\p
\v 8 Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, despise authority, and speak evil of dignitaries.
\p
\v 9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing judgment, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
\p
\v 10 But these rail at those things which they know not; but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.
\p
\v 11 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah.
\p
\v 12 These are spots in your love-feasts, when they feast with you. feeding themselves without fear; clouds without water, carried about by winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
\p
\v 13 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
\p
\v 14 And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these also, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with tens of thousands of his saints,
\p
\v 15 To execute judgment upon all, and to convict all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which in their ungodliness they have committed, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
\p
\v 16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking according to their own desires; and their mouth speaketh great swelling \add words,\add* admiring persons for the sake of profit.
\p
\v 17 ¶ But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
\p
\v 18 That they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly desires.
\p
\v 19 These are they who make separation, sensual, having not the Spirit.
\p
\v 20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
\p
\v 21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
\p
\v 22 And of some have compassion, making a difference:
\p
\v 23 And others save with fear, snatching \add them\add* out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
\p
\v 24 Now unto him that is able to guard you from stumbling, and to present \add you\add* faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,
\p
\v 25 To the only wise God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.

\mt1 The Revelation
\mt3 of St. John the Divine
\c 1
\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified \add it\add* by his angel unto his servant John:
\p
\v 2 Who testified of the word of God and the witness of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw.
\p
\v 3 Blessed \add is\add* he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein; for the time \add is\add* at hand.
\p
\v 4 ¶ John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you, and peace, from him who is, and who was, and who is ito come; and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne;
\p
\v 5 And from Jesus Christ, \add who is\add* the faithful witness, \add and\add* the first-begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loveth us, and hath washed us from our sins in his own blood,
\p
\v 6 And hath made us a kingdom, priests unto God and his Father; to him \add be\add* glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they \add also\add* that pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
\p
\v 8 I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.
\p
\v 9 I John, your brother, and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus, was in the isle called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus.
\p
\v 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,
\p
\v 11 Saying, What thou seest, write in a book, and send to the seven churches: unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamus, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
\p
\v 12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
\p
\v 13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks \add one\add* like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle;
\p
\v 14 His head and hair white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes as a flame of fire;
\p
\v 15 And his feet like unto molten brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
\p
\v 16 And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out of his mouth went forth a sharp two-edged sword; and his countenance \add was\add* as the sun shineth in its strength.
\p
\v 17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last,
\p
\v 18 And the Living One; and I was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore; and have the keys of death and of Hades.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Write therefore the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall take place after these.
\p
\v 20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ Unto the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;
\p
\v 2 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and that thou canst not bear them that are evil; and thou hast tried them that say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:
\p
\v 3 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.
\p
\v 4 Nevertheless I have \add this\add* against thee, that thou hast left thy first love.
\p
\v 5 Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.
\p
\v 6 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.
\p
\v 7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These things saith the first and the last, who was dead and is alive:
\p
\v 9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and are not, but a synagogue of Satan.
\p
\v 10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer; behold, the devil shall cast \add some\add* of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful even unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.
\p
\v 11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And to the angel of the church in Pergamus write: These things saith he that hath the sharp sword with two edges;
\p
\v 13 I know where thou dwellest, where Satan’s throne \add is:\add* and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas \add was\add* my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.
\p
\v 14 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.
\p
\v 15 So hast thou also them that hold the teaching of the Nicolaitanes, in like manner.
\p
\v 16 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
\p
\v 17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth \add it.\add*
\p
\v 18 ¶ And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like molten brass:
\p
\v 19 I know thy works, and love, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to \add be\add* more than the first.
\p
\v 20 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach, and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.
\p
\v 21 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.
\p
\v 22 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of her deeds.
\p
\v 23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts; and I will give unto each one of you according to your works.
\p
\v 24 But unto you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, such as have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say, I will put upon you no other burden.
\p
\v 25 But that which ye have, hold fast till I come.
\p
\v 26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations;
\p
\v 27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken in pieces, as I also have received from my Father.
\p
\v 28 And I will give him the morning star.
\p
\v 29 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.
\p
\v 2 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die; for I have not found thy works completed before my God.
\p
\v 3 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.
\p
\v 4 But thou hast a few names even in Sardis that have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
\p
\v 5 He that overcometh shall thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not blot his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
\p
\v 6 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things saith the Holy, the True, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;
\p
\v 8 I know thy works. Behold, I have set before thee an open door, which no one can shut; for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
\p
\v 9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, that say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
\p
\v 10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of trial, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.
\p
\v 11 I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no one take thy crown.
\p
\v 12 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God; and my new name.
\p
\v 13 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And unto the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God:
\p
\v 15 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would thou wert cold or hot.
\p
\v 16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I spew thee out of my mouth.
\p
\v 17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked;
\p
\v 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and \add that\add* the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayest see.
\p
\v 19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous therefore, and repent.
\p
\v 20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock. If any one hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in unto him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
\p
\v 21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.
\p
\v 22 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ After these things I saw, and, behold, a door opened in heaven; and that first voice which I heard \add was\add* as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which must take place after these.
\p
\v 2 Immediately I was in the Spirit; and, behold, a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne.
\p
\v 3 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardius; and \add there was\add* a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
\p
\v 4 And round about the throne \add were\add* four-and-twenty thrones; and upon the thrones I saw four-and-twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.
\p
\v 5 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices; and \add there were\add* seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
\p
\v 6 And before the throne \add there was\add* a sea of glass like unto crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, \add were\add* four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.
\p
\v 7 And the first living creature \add was\add* like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had a face as a man, and the fourth living creature \add was\add* like a flying eagle.
\p
\v 8 And the four living creatures, having each of them six wings, around and within are full of eyes; and they rest not, day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.
\p
\v 9 And when the living creatures give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,
\p
\v 10 The four-and-twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
\p
\v 11 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for thou hast created all things, and by thy will they are, and were created.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
\p
\v 2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
\p
\v 3 And no one in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon.
\p
\v 4 And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And one of the elders saith unto me. Weep not; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.
\p
\v 6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb, as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
\p
\v 7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
\p
\v 8 And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four-and-twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
\p
\v 9 And they sang a new song, saying. Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
\p
\v 10 And hast made them unto our God kings and priests; and they shall reign on the earth.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
\p
\v 12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.
\p
\v 13 And every creature that is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, \add be\add* unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb I for ever and ever.
\p
\v 14 And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ And I saw, when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four living creatures saying, Come!
\p
\v 2 And I saw, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon it had a bow; and a crown was given unto him; and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
\p
\v 3 ¶ And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, Come!
\p
\v 4 And there went out another, a red horse; and it was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another; and there was given unto him a great sword.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come! And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat upon it had a pair of balances in his hand.
\p
\v 6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say, A measure of wheat for a denarius, and three measures of barley for a denarius; and, Do not hurt the oil and the wine.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, Come!
\p
\v 8 And I looked, and behold a pale horse; and he that sat upon it, his name was Death, and Hades followed with him. And authority was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held;
\p
\v 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
\p
\v 11 And a white robe was given unto each one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, who were about to be killed as they, should be fulfilled.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the full moon became as blood;
\p
\v 13 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth its unripe figs, when shaken by a mighty wind.
\p
\v 14 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
\p
\v 15 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
\p
\v 16 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;
\p
\v 17 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
\c 7
\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 ¶ And after this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
\p
\v 2 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
\p
\v 3 Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.
\p
\v 4 And I heard the number of them that were sealed: \add and there were\add* sealed a hundred and forty-and-four thousand, out of all the tribes of the sons of Israel:
\p
\v 5 Of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand sealed; the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand; the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;
\p
\v 6 The tribe of Asher, twelve thousand; the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand; the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand;
\p
\v 7 The tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand; the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand;
\p
\v 8 The tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand; the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand sealed.
\p
\v 9 ¶ After these things I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no one could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.
\p
\v 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
\p
\v 11 And all the angels stood round about the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,
\p
\v 12 Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, \add be\add* unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 13 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, Who are these that are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?
\p
\v 14 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
\p
\v 15 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he that sitteth on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them.
\p
\v 16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun smite them, nor any heat.
\p
\v 17 For the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them, and shall lead them unto fountains of waters of life; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
\c 8
\cl CHAPTER 8
\p
\v 1 ¶ And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.
\p
\v 2 And I saw the seven angels that stand before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.
\p
\v 3 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer \add it\add* with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
\p
\v 4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand.
\p
\v 5 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast \add it\add* upon the earth; and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
\p
\v 6 And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
\p
\v 7 ¶ The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth; and the third part of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood;
\p
\v 9 And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
\p
\v 11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.
\p
\v 13 And I beheld, and heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are about to sound !
\c 9
\cl CHAPTER 9
\p
\v 1 ¶ And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fallen from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the pit of the abyss.
\p
\v 2 And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
\p
\v 3 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth; and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
\p
\v 4 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree; but only those men who had not the seal of God on their foreheads.
\p
\v 5 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and their torment \add was\add* as the torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a man.
\p
\v 6 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
\p
\v 7 And the shapes of the locusts \add were\add* like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads \add were\add* as it were crowns like gold, and their faces \add were\add* as the faces of men.
\p
\v 8 And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as \add the teeth\add* of lions.
\p
\v 9 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings \add was\add* as the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle.
\p
\v 10 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power \add was\add* to hurt men five months.
\p
\v 11 And they had over them as king the angel of the abyss, whose name in the Hebrew tongue \add is\add* Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue he hath a name, Apollyon.
\p
\v 12 One woe is past; \add and,\add* behold, there come two woes more hereafter.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
\p
\v 14 Saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet, Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates.
\p
\v 15 And the four angels were loosed, that had been prepared for the hour, and day and month and year, that they should slay the third part of men.
\p
\v 16 And the number of the army of the horsemen was two hundred thousand thousand; I heard the number of them.
\p
\v 17 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of hyacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses \add were\add* as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.
\p
\v 18 By these three plagues were the third part of men killed: by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.
\p
\v 19 For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails \add were\add* like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they hurt.
\p
\v 20 And the rest of the men, who were not killed by these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they should cease to worship demons, and idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood: which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk;
\p
\v 21 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
\c 10
\cl CHAPTER 10
\p
\v 1 ¶ And I saw another mighty angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow \add was\add* upon his head, and his face \add was\add* as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire;
\p
\v 2 And he had in his hand a little book open; and he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left on the earth,
\p
\v 3 And cried with a loud voice, as:a lion roareth; and when he had cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
\p
\v 4 And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice out of heaven saying, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.
\p
\v 5 And the angel that I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,
\p
\v 6 And swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that therein are, and the earth and the things that therein are, and the sea and the things which are therein, that there should be delay no longer;
\p
\v 7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, then is the mystery of God finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
\p
\v 9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.
\p
\v 10 And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey, and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
\p
\v 11 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again of many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.
\c 11
\cl CHAPTER 11
\p
\v 1 ¶ And there was given me a reed like unto a rod, and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.
\p
\v 2 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles; and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty-two months.
\p
\v 3 And I will give to my two witnesses, that they may prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.
\p
\v 4 These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the Lord of the earth.
\p
\v 5 And if any one wishes to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies; and if any one wishes to hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.
\p
\v 6 These have power to shut the heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy; and have power over the waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
\p
\v 7 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the abyss shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
\p
\v 8 And their dead bodies \add shall lie\add* in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
\p
\v 9 And they of the peoples and kindreds and tongues and nations shall look upon their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in a tomb.
\p
\v 10 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And after three days and a half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that saw them.
\p
\v 12 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
\p
\v 13 And the same hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand; and the rest became afraid, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
\p
\v 14 The second woe is past; behold, the third woe cometh quickly.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world hath become our Lord’s, and his Christ’s; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
\p
\v 16 And the four-and-twenty elders, who sat before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
\p
\v 17 Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord, God, the Almighty, who art, and who wast; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.
\p
\v 18 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and that thou shouldst give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldst destroy them that destroy the earth.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant; and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and a great hail.
\c 12
\cl CHAPTER 12
\p
\v 1 ¶ And there appeared a great sign in heaven: a woman, clothed with the sun; and the moon under her feet; and upon her head a crown of twelve stars;
\p
\v 2 And she, being with child, cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
\p
\v 3 And there appeared another sign in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems upon his heads.
\p
\v 4 And his tail dragged the third part of the stars of heaven, and it cast them to the earth; and the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered, to devour her child as soon as it was born.
\p
\v 5 And she brought forth a man-child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up unto God, and \add to\add* his throne.
\p
\v 6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred \add and\add* threescore days.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
\p
\v 8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
\p
\v 9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
\p
\v 10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night.
\p
\v 11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives, even to the death.
\p
\v 12 Therefore rejoice, \add ye\add* heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! For the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man\add -child.\add*
\p
\v 14 And to the woman were given the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
\p
\v 15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.
\p
\v 16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
\p
\v 17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus.
\c 13
\cl CHAPTER 13
\p
\v 1 ¶ And I stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
\p
\v 2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet as of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.
\p
\v 3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed; and all the world wondered after the beast.
\p
\v 4 And they worshipped the dragon because he gave his authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who \add is\add* like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?
\p
\v 5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and authority was given unto him to continue forty-two months.
\p
\v 6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
\p
\v 7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them; and authority was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.
\p
\v 8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb slain.
\p
\v 9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.
\p
\v 10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
\p
\v 12 And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
\p
\v 13 And he doeth great signs, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,
\p
\v 14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by those signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
\p
\v 15 And it was given to him to give breath unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
\p
\v 16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead;
\p
\v 17 And that no one might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
\p
\v 18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number \add is\add* Six hundred threescore \add and\add* six.
\c 14
\cl CHAPTER 14
\p
\v 1 ¶ And I looked, and, lo, the Lamb stood upon mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having his name and his Father’s, written on their foreheads.
\p
\v 2 And I heard a voice out of heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and the voice that I heard was that of harpers, harping with their harps;
\p
\v 3 And they sang as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who were redeemed from the earth.
\p
\v 4 These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, a firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
\p
\v 5 And in their mouth was found no falsehood; they are blameless.
\p
\v 6 ¶ And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
\p
\v 7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
\p
\v 8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, which made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive \add his\add* mark on his forehead, or on his hand,
\p
\v 10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb;
\p
\v 11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
\p
\v 12 Here is the patience of the saints; here \add are\add* they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And I heard a voice out of heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth; yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.
\p
\v 14 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
\p
\v 15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. 
\p
\v 16 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.
\p
\v 17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
\p
\v 18 And another angel came out from the altar, having authority over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for its grapes are fully ripe.
\p
\v 19 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast \add it\add* into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
\p
\v 20 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse-bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.
\c 15
\cl CHAPTER 15
\p
\v 1 ¶ And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven plagues, the last, for in them is completed the wrath of God.
\p
\v 2 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and they that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
\p
\v 3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous \add are\add* thy works, Lord God, the Almighty; just and true \add are\add* thy ways, thou King of ages.
\p
\v 4 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for \add thou\add* only \add art\add* holy; for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteousnesses are made manifest.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened;
\p
\v 6 And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.
\p
\v 7 And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
\p
\v 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no one was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.
\c 16
\cl CHAPTER 16
\p
\v 1 ¶ And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth.
\p
\v 2 ¶ And the first went, and poured out his bowl upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men who had the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.
\p
\v 3 ¶ And the second poured out his bowl upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead \add man:\add* and every living soul died, the things that were in the sea.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And the third poured out his bowl upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
\p
\v 5 And I heard the angel of the waters say. Thou art righteous, who art, and wast, the Holy One, because thou hast thus judged.
\p
\v 6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; they are worthy.
\p
\v 7 And I heard the altar saying. Even so, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous \add are\add* thy judgments.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given to it to scorch men with fire.
\p
\v 9 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, who had power over these plagues; and they repented not, to give him glory.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was filled with darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
\p
\v 11 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.
\p
\v 12 And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared.
\p
\v 13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs \add come\add* out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
\p
\v 14 For they are the spirits of demons, working signs, and they go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of the great day of God, the Almighty.
\p
\v 15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed \add is\add* he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.
\p
\v 16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
\p
\v 18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, so great.
\p
\v 19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
\p
\v 20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
\p
\v 21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, as of a talent’s weight; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.
\c 17
\cl CHAPTER 17
\p
\v 1 ¶ And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will show unto thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters;
\p
\v 2 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
\p
\v 3 So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
\p
\v 4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication;
\p
\v 5 And upon her forehead \add was\add* a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
\p
\v 6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus; and when I saw her, I wondered with great wonder.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And the angel said unto me. Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, that hath the seven heads and ten horns.
\p
\v 8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to ascend out of the abyss and to go into perdition; and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast, that it was, and is not, and shall be.
\p
\v 9 Here \add is\add* the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.
\p
\v 10 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, \add and\add* the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a little while.
\p
\v 11 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is an eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.
\p
\v 12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but receive authority as kings one hour with the beast.
\p
\v 13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and authority unto the beast.
\p
\v 14 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them; for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him \add are\add* called, and chosen, and faithful.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
\p
\v 16 And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her up with fire.
\p
\v 17 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
\p
\v 18 And the woman whom thou sawest is that great city, which hath a kingdom over the kings of the earth.
\c 18
\cl CHAPTER 18
\p
\v 1 ¶ And after these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lightened with his glory.
\p
\v 2 And he cried with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of demons, and a prison of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
\p
\v 3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her luxury.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye may not have fellowship with her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
\p
\v 5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
\p
\v 6 Reward her even as she also rewarded, and double unto her double according to her works; in the cup which she hath mixed, mix to her double.
\p
\v 7 By as much as she hath glorified herself, and lived in luxury, so much torment and sorrow give her; for she saith in her .heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
\p
\v 8 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong \add is\add* the Lord God who judgeth her.
\p
\v 9 And the kings of the earth, who bave committed fornication and lived in luxury with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
\p
\v 10 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas! that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
\p
\v 11 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no one buyeth their merchandise any more;
\p
\v 12 The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine-wood, and every article of ivory, and every article of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,
\p
\v 13 And cinnamon, and perfumes, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.
\p
\v 14 And the fruits that thy soul desired have departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly have perished from thee, and they shall find them no more at all.
\p
\v 15 The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
\p
\v 16 And saying, Alas, alas! that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!
\p
\v 17 For in one hour so great wealth hath been made desolate! And every shipmaster, and every voyager, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,
\p
\v 18 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying. What \add city is\add* like unto this great city!
\p
\v 19 And they cast dust on their heads, and cried out, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas! that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea, by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.
\p
\v 20 Rejoice over her, \add thou\add* heaven, and \add ye\add* saints, and apostles, and prophets; for God hath judged your judgment upon her.
\p
\v 21 ¶ And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast \add it\add* into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
\p
\v 22 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft \add he be,\add* shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;
\p
\v 23 And the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of bridegroom and of bride shall be heard no more at all in thee; for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
\p
\v 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that had been slain upon the earth.
\c 19
\cl CHAPTER 19
\p
\v 1 ¶ After these things I heard a loud voice as of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia! The salvation, and the glory, and the power, are our God’s!
\p
\v 2 For true and righteous \add are\add* his judgments: for he hath judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
\p
\v 3 And again they said, Alleluia! And her smoke goeth up for ever and ever.
\p
\v 4 And the four-and-twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen! Alleluia!
\p
\v 5 And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, ye that fear him, both small and great.
\p
\v 6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying. Alleluia! for the Lord God, the Almighty, hath become King!
\p
\v 7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
\p
\v 8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, shining, pure: for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.
\p
\v 9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed \add are\add* they that are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.
\p
\v 10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See \add thou do it\add* not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus; worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and One sitting upon it, called Faithful and True; and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
\p
\v 12 His eyes are as a flame of fire, and on his head, many diadems; having a name written, which no one knoweth but he himself.
\p
\v 13 And he is clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God.
\p
\v 14 And the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and pure.
\p
\v 15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.
\p
\v 16 And he hath on \add his\add* vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
\p
\v 17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven. Come and gather yourselves together unto the great supper of God;
\p
\v 18 That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of chief captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all, both free and bond, and small and great.
\p
\v 19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
\p
\v 20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought signs before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into the lake of fire that burneth with brimstone.
\p
\v 21 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which proceeded out of his mouth; and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
\c 20
\cl CHAPTER 20
\p
\v 1 ¶ And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the pit of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.
\p
\v 2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
\p
\v 3 And cast him into the pit of the abyss, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled; and after that he must be loosed a little season.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them; and the souls of them that had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and whoever had not worshipped the beast, nor his image, nor had received \add his\add* mark upon their foreheads, or on their hands; and they lived again, and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
\p
\v 5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This \add is\add* the first resurrection.
\p
\v 6 Blessed and holy \add is\add* he that hath part in the first resurrection; over these the second death hath no authority, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
\p
\v 8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war; the number of whom \add is\add* as the sand of the sea.
\p
\v 9 And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
\p
\v 10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
\p
\v 12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne. And books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
\p
\v 13 And the sea gave up the dead who were in it; and death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them; and they were judged, every one, according to their works.
\p
\v 14 And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
\p
\v 15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
\c 21
\cl CHAPTER 21
\p
\v 1 ¶ And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
\p
\v 2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
\p
\v 3 And I heard a great voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God \add is\add* with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.
\p
\v 4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said, Write; for these words are true and faithful.
\p
\v 6 And he said unto me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
\p
\v 7 He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
\p
\v 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And there came unto me one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.
\p
\v 10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
\p
\v 11 Having the glory of God; and her light \add was\add* like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
\p
\v 12 Having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are \add the names\add* of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel;
\p
\v 13 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
\p
\v 14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
\p
\v 15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
\p
\v 16 And the city lieth four-square, and the length is as great as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
\p
\v 17 And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
\p
\v 18 And the building of the wall of it was \add of\add* jasper: and the city \add was\add* pure gold, like unto clear glass.
\p
\v 19 And the foundations of the wall of the city \add were\add* garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation \add was\add* jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
\p
\v 20 The fifth, sardony; the sixth sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
\p
\v 21 And the twelve gates \add were\add* twelve pearls; each separate gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city \add was\add* pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
\p
\v 22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple of it.
\p
\v 23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine on it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb \add is\add* the light thereof.
\p
\v 24 And the nations shall walk by its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.
\p
\v 25 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day; (for there shall be no night there.)
\p
\v 26 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
\p
\v 27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, nor \add whatsoever\add* worketh abomination, or \add maketh\add* a lie; but those only who are written in the Lamb’s «book of life.
\c 22
\cl CHAPTER 22
\p
\v 1 ¶ And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
\p
\v 2 In the midst of its street, and on either side of the river, \add was\add* a tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
\p
\v 3 And there shall be no more curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
\p
\v 4 And they shall see his face; and his name \add shall be\add* in their foreheads.
\p
\v 5 And there shall be no night there; and they need no lamp, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light; and they shall reign for ever and ever.
\p
\v 6 And he said unto me. These sayings \add are\add* faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass.
\p
\v 7 And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And I John saw these things, and heard \add them.\add* And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things.
\p
\v 9 Then saith he unto me. See \add thou do it\add* not: for I am a fellowservant with thee, and with thy brethren the prophets, and with them that keep the sayings of this book; worship God.
\p
\v 10 And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.
\p
\v 11 He that doeth unrighteously, let him do unrighteously still; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
\p
\v 12 Behold, I come quickly; and my reward \add is\add* with me, to give each one according as his work shall be.
\p
\v 13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
\p
\v 14 Blessed \add are\add* they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.
\p
\v 15 Without \add are\add* the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.
\p
\v 16 I Jesus have sent my angel to I testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright and morning star.
\p
\v 17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
\p
\v 18 ¶ I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any one shall add to them, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book:
\p
\v 19 And if any one shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written of in this book.
\p
\v 20 He that testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen; come, Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints. Amen.
